ID,Title,Abstract
1,"Machine Learning Approaches to Predicting Stock Market Volatility During Economic Crises","This study explores the use of supervised machine learning models—Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and LSTM networks—to forecast stock market volatility during economic downturns. Using historical data from the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic, the models demonstrated improved accuracy over traditional GARCH methods, particularly in detecting early signs of volatility clustering."
2,"The Impact of Social Media Sentiment on Short-Term Stock Price Movements","This paper investigates how sentiment extracted from platforms like Twitter and Reddit influences short-term stock price behavior. Natural language processing techniques were applied to millions of posts, revealing statistically significant correlations between positive sentiment spikes and abnormal returns in small-cap stocks."
3,"Cryptocurrency as a Hedge Asset During Traditional Market Downturns","Analyzing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin price movements during major equity market corrections, this research evaluates the diversification benefits of including cryptocurrencies in investment portfolios. Results suggest that while crypto assets exhibit low correlation with equities, their high volatility limits their effectiveness as stable hedge instruments."
4,"High-Frequency Trading and Market Liquidity: An Empirical Study Across Global Exchanges","This empirical analysis examines the relationship between high-frequency trading (HFT) activity and liquidity measures such as bid-ask spreads and order book depth across five major global exchanges. Findings indicate that HFT improves liquidity under normal conditions but exacerbates volatility during periods of market stress."
5,"The Role of Central Bank Communication in Shaping Financial Market Expectations","Using textual analysis and event studies, this research quantifies how central bank statements influence asset prices and investor expectations. Language sentiment and forward guidance were found to significantly impact bond yields and currency exchange rates within minutes of release."
6,"Behavioral Biases in Retail Investor Decision-Making During Market Bubbles","Through behavioral experiments and transaction log analysis, this study identifies common cognitive biases—such as herd mentality and overconfidence—that drive retail investors during speculative bubbles. The findings support the need for enhanced investor education and decision-support tools."
7,"The Effect of ESG Ratings on Corporate Bond Pricing and Default Risk","This paper analyzes whether environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores affect the pricing and risk profiles of corporate bonds. Regression models show that firms with higher ESG ratings tend to have lower yield spreads and reduced probabilities of default, suggesting that ESG performance is increasingly priced into fixed income markets."
8,"Quantifying the Influence of Macroeconomic Indicators on Equity Returns in Emerging Markets","Using panel data from 10 emerging economies, this study assesses the predictive power of GDP growth, inflation, and interest rate changes on equity returns. Results indicate that inflation surprises and U.S. Federal Reserve announcements have outsized impacts on market valuations in these regions."
9,"Market Reaction to Mergers and Acquisitions: A Cross-Country Analysis","Event study methodology is employed to evaluate shareholder value creation around M&A announcements in both developed and emerging markets. On average, acquirers experience negative cumulative abnormal returns, while target firms benefit significantly, with effects varying by regulatory environment and deal structure."
10,"Algorithmic Trading Strategies and Their Performance During Periods of Market Stress","This backtesting study compares the resilience of various algorithmic trading strategies—including momentum, mean reversion, and reinforcement learning—during historically volatile periods. Reinforcement learning strategies outperformed rule-based systems in terms of drawdown management and adaptability to changing market dynamics."
11,"The Emergence of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Its Implications for Traditional Banking","This qualitative and quantitative review explores how decentralized finance applications challenge traditional banking functions such as lending, borrowing, and asset management. DeFi's rapid growth highlights opportunities for innovation but also raises concerns about regulatory oversight and systemic risk."
12,"The Impact of Geopolitical Tensions on Commodity Futures Markets","Using geopolitical risk indices and commodity futures data, this research examines how conflicts and political instability influence price volatility in oil, gold, and agricultural commodities. Oil futures showed the strongest response to geopolitical shocks, especially in Middle Eastern conflict scenarios."
13,"Fintech Disruption and Its Effects on Consumer Banking Behavior","This survey-based and econometric study analyzes how fintech innovations such as mobile payments, robo-advisors, and digital lending platforms are reshaping consumer preferences and trust in financial institutions. Results indicate a growing shift toward digital-first providers, particularly among younger demographics."
14,"Market Efficiency and the Persistence of Technical Trading Rules in Modern Markets","Despite theoretical claims of market efficiency, technical trading rules continue to be widely used. This study tests popular indicators like moving averages and RSI on recent equity data and finds limited but statistically significant predictability in short timeframes, suggesting some inefficiencies remain exploitable."
15,"The Relationship Between Insider Trading and Future Stock Performance","This paper investigates whether insider buying and selling activity can predict future stock returns. Using SEC filings and market data, the study finds that insider purchases are positively correlated with subsequent positive abnormal returns, particularly when multiple insiders trade simultaneously."
16,"Regulatory Changes and Their Impact on Hedge Fund Performance","This research evaluates how post-financial-crisis regulations such as MiFID II and Dodd-Frank have affected hedge fund returns and risk-adjusted performance metrics. Findings suggest that increased transparency requirements have not significantly harmed performance but have led to consolidation in the industry."
17,"The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Fraud Detection and Risk Management in Financial Institutions","AI-driven anomaly detection models are tested for their ability to identify fraudulent transactions and prevent operational risks. Supervised and unsupervised learning approaches achieved high precision in flagging suspicious activities, offering scalable solutions for real-time fraud prevention."
18,"Exchange Rate Volatility and Export Competitiveness: Evidence from Asian Manufacturing Economies","This macroeconomic study assesses how fluctuations in exchange rates affect export volumes in select Asian countries. While moderate depreciation boosts competitiveness, excessive volatility leads to uncertainty and reduced trade flows, highlighting the importance of currency stability policies."
19,"Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs): Investor Behavior and Post-Launch Performance","Analyzing over 1,000 ICOs, this study explores fundraising success factors and post-launch token performance. Projects with clear whitepapers and credible teams raised more capital, but nearly 60% of tokens lost over 90% of their value within six months, indicating high failure rates and speculative nature."
20,"The Impact of Interest Rate Changes on Mortgage-Backed Securities Valuation","This valuation study uses duration and convexity models to assess how shifts in interest rates affect mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Prepayment risk was found to significantly distort MBS sensitivity to rate changes, especially in low-rate environments where refinancing surges."
21,"Investor Attention and Its Influence on IPO Underpricing","Drawing on Google Trends and media coverage data, this study examines how public attention affects initial public offering (IPO) pricing. High levels of pre-IPO search volume correlate with greater underpricing, suggesting that hype and information asymmetry play key roles in market mispricing."
22,"The Evolution of Systematic Trading Strategies Over the Past Three Decades","This historical analysis reviews the development of systematic trading strategies—from basic trend-following to deep learning models—and evaluates how their performance has evolved. Early strategies performed well until the mid-2010s, after which increasing competition and market adaptation reduced edge."
23,"Corporate Governance and Stock Market Reactions to Earnings Announcements","This event study investigates how strong governance structures influence investor reactions to earnings surprises. Firms with independent boards and transparent disclosures experienced smaller negative reactions to bad news and stronger positive responses to good news, underscoring governance as a market confidence factor."
24,"The Rise of Passive Investing and Its Implications for Market Efficiency","As passive investing grows, concerns arise about its impact on market efficiency and asset pricing. This paper finds evidence of declining analyst coverage and reduced price informativeness in heavily indexed stocks, raising questions about long-term market functionality."
25,"Quantifying Tail Risk in Equity Portfolios Using Extreme Value Theory","This paper applies extreme value theory to estimate tail risk in diversified equity portfolios. Compared to traditional VaR models, the EVT approach provides more accurate estimates of extreme losses, improving risk management practices for portfolio managers and regulators."
