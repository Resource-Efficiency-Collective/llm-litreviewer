ID,Title,Abstract
1,"Habitat Fragmentation and Movement Patterns of Polar Bears in Response to Sea Ice Loss","This study investigates how declining Arctic sea ice affects polar bear movement using GPS telemetry data from 40 individuals across three subpopulations. Results indicate increased travel distances and altered seasonal migration patterns, suggesting that habitat fragmentation is forcing polar bears to expend more energy in search of stable hunting grounds."
2,"Dietary Shifts in Polar Bears as a Response to Declining Seal Availability","Using stable isotope analysis and scat surveys, this research documents changes in polar bear diets over the past two decades. Findings show an increasing reliance on terrestrial food sources such as bird eggs and vegetation, which may not provide sufficient caloric intake for long-term survival in the absence of seal prey."
3,"Assessing the Impact of Climate Change on Polar Bear Denning Behavior","Climate warming is altering snow cover dynamics critical for successful polar bear denning. This study evaluates den site fidelity and thermal insulation properties of dens under varying snow conditions. Results suggest that warmer winters are reducing den stability and increasing cub mortality risk."
4,"The Role of Genetic Diversity in Polar Bear Adaptation to Rapid Environmental Change","Genetic diversity is crucial for species resilience to environmental stressors. This genomic study of 100 polar bears across the Arctic reveals moderate genetic variation but identifies isolated populations at risk due to reduced gene flow, emphasizing the need for conservation strategies that maintain genetic connectivity."
5,"Evaluating Human-Polar Bear Conflicts in Coastal Communities Under Changing Sea Ice Conditions","As sea ice retreats, polar bears are spending more time near human settlements, leading to increased conflict. This case study from five Arctic communities analyzes incident reports and mitigation strategies, showing that proactive measures such as deterrent systems and community education significantly reduce negative encounters."
6,"Thermoregulation and Energy Expenditure in Swimming Polar Bears","Prolonged swimming has become more common for polar bears due to longer distances between sea ice floes. Using accelerometers and biologging devices, this study estimates energy costs of long-distance swims and finds that while adult bears can manage short swims, extended journeys may be energetically unsustainable for cubs and weaker individuals."
7,"Population Trends of Polar Bears in the Southern Beaufort Sea (2001–2023)","Aerial and mark-recapture surveys were used to assess population trends in one of the most studied polar bear subpopulations. Results show a decline of approximately 40% since 2001, correlating with significant reductions in sea ice duration and associated declines in body condition and reproductive success."
8,"The Use of Drones for Non-Invasive Monitoring of Polar Bear Populations","This study explores the feasibility of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for monitoring polar bear abundance and behavior without disturbing natural activity. Drone footage provided accurate counts and behavioral data, with minimal visible reaction from observed bears, supporting their use as a safe and effective survey tool."
9,"Cub Survival Rates in Relation to Maternal Body Condition and Sea Ice Availability","Maternal health plays a key role in cub survival. This longitudinal study links satellite-derived body condition indices of female polar bears to cub survival rates. Bears in poor condition during breeding seasons had significantly lower cub survival, likely due to inadequate fat stores for lactation and protection in early life stages."
10,"Mercury Levels in Polar Bears Across the Circumpolar Arctic","Polar bears are apex predators and bioindicators of contaminant levels in Arctic ecosystems. This study measures mercury concentrations in tissue samples from 60 polar bears across six regions. Mercury levels were found to exceed thresholds linked to neurotoxic effects, raising concerns about ecosystem-wide contamination and its impacts on top predators."
11,"Modeling Future Polar Bear Habitat Under IPCC Climate Scenarios","Using climate projections from multiple IPCC models, this research forecasts polar bear habitat suitability through 2100. Results suggest that even under moderate warming scenarios, suitable sea ice habitat could decline by over 70%, threatening the long-term viability of several subpopulations unless greenhouse gas emissions are curtailed."
12,"Behavioral Responses of Polar Bears to Novel Prey Encounters in Terrestrial Environments","With less access to seals, polar bears are encountering new prey types on land. This observational study records interactions with caribou, birds, and fish, noting limited hunting success and high energetic costs, indicating that alternative prey may not compensate for loss of marine resources."
13,"Impacts of Offshore Oil Exploration on Polar Bear Movement and Foraging Behavior","Industrial activity in the Arctic is increasing, particularly offshore oil exploration. This study uses telemetry data to evaluate how seismic surveys and vessel traffic affect polar bear movements. Results show temporary displacement and increased vigilance behaviors, suggesting potential long-term disruptions to feeding patterns."
14,"The Role of Sea Ice Albedo Feedback in Polar Bear Habitat Loss","Sea ice albedo feedback amplifies Arctic warming, accelerating habitat loss for polar bears. This interdisciplinary study combines remote sensing and ecological modeling to quantify the cascading effects of reduced reflectivity on sea ice persistence and polar bear range contraction."
15,"Use of Camera Traps to Monitor Polar Bear Activity in Remote Arctic Regions","Camera trap networks offer a non-invasive method for tracking polar bear presence and behavior in remote areas. This pilot project deployed 50 cameras across coastal zones and found consistent seasonal visitation patterns, providing valuable data for estimating population density and movement corridors."
16,"Assessing the Efficacy of Conservation Corridors for Maintaining Polar Bear Connectivity","As sea ice diminishes, maintaining genetic and spatial connectivity becomes challenging. This landscape genetics study evaluates proposed conservation corridors linking fragmented habitats and finds that corridor placement must adapt dynamically to shifting ice patterns to remain effective."
17,"Physiological Stress Responses in Polar Bears Exposed to Human Disturbance","Fecal glucocorticoid metabolites were analyzed in polar bears exposed to aircraft overflights, tourism, and industrial operations. Elevated stress hormone levels were detected following disturbances, highlighting the need for buffer zones and disturbance protocols in sensitive areas."
18,"Polar Bear Predation on Seabird Colonies During On-Land Foraging Periods","Recent observations indicate polar bears increasingly preying on seabird colonies during summer months. This study quantifies predation rates and nesting success in affected colonies, finding significant decreases in seabird reproduction where polar bear visits are frequent."
19,"Comparative Analysis of Polar Bear and Brown Bear Hybridization Events in the Arctic","Hybridization between polar bears and brown bears is increasing due to overlapping ranges driven by climate change. This genetic analysis confirms hybrid status in several individuals and discusses implications for species integrity and conservation policy under the Endangered Species Act."
20,"Long-Term Effects of Reduced Sea Ice Duration on Polar Bear Body Condition","Body condition is a key indicator of health in polar bears. Using drone-based photogrammetry and field measurements over 15 years, this study shows a steady decline in average body mass, particularly among males, correlated with shorter annual periods of accessible sea ice."
21,"The Role of Marine Protected Areas in Polar Bear Conservation","Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been proposed as tools to safeguard polar bear habitat. This review evaluates current MPAs in polar bear range states and finds that only a small percentage align with core foraging zones, recommending strategic expansion to enhance conservation outcomes."
22,"Reproductive Success of Polar Bears in a Warming Arctic Environment","This study examines reproductive parameters including litter size and inter-birth intervals in relation to sea ice availability. Data show a decrease in litter size and longer intervals between births, suggesting that nutritional stress due to reduced hunting opportunities is affecting reproductive fitness."
23,"Developing Early Warning Systems for Polar Bear Incursions into Human Settlements","This study tests predictive models based on satellite imagery and weather data to anticipate when polar bears are likely to approach human settlements. Machine learning algorithms achieved 78% accuracy in predicting incursion events up to 72 hours in advance, offering a promising tool for community preparedness."
24,"The Impacts of Plastic Pollution on Polar Bear Health and Foraging Behavior","Although rarely documented, plastic ingestion was identified in several necropsied polar bears. This study reviews global pollution trends and suggests that microplastics and debris may enter the food chain through seal prey, potentially impacting predator health and immune function."
25,"Using Artificial Intelligence to Classify Polar Bear Behavior from Remote Sensing Data","AI-based image recognition systems were trained to classify polar bear behavior from camera trap and drone footage. The model successfully categorized resting, walking, swimming, and feeding behaviors with over 90% accuracy, offering scalable tools for long-term monitoring efforts."
