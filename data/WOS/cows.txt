Cow-calf contact, or lack thereof, is expected to affect emotional states, but this requires empirical testing. Different types of cow-calf contact may also affect the emotional states of cows. The primary objective of this study was to assess the emotional state of dairy cows with full-time (23 h/d), part-time (10 h/d), or no-contact with their calves (separated 48 h after birth), using a visual judgment bias test (JBT) about one month after calving; JBT is the current gold-standard method to assess emotional state in animals by evaluating optimism or pessimism (illustrated by the proverbial half-full or half-empty water glass). The secondary objective was to compare outcomes of color- versus shape-based visual JBT. Fifty dairy cows were trained to approach a positive image on a screen (rewarded with food) and to avoid a negative image (else punished with waving bag). Once learned (>80% correct over 2 consecutive days), cows were presented with 3 ambiguous images (each presented once per day among 4 positive and 3 negative images, repeated over 4 d), and their approach responses recorded. For the color method (10 full-time, 9 part-time and 11 no-contact cows), positive and negative images were a solid red or white background; ambiguous images were shades of pink. For the shape method (8 full-time, 6 part-time and 6 no-contact cows), positive and negative images were a white circle or cross on a black background; ambiguous images were overlaid circle and cross in varying shades of gray. Cows learned to discriminate colors quicker than shapes (7.3 d, confidence limits [CL]: 6.6-8.2 d; vs. 9.3 d, CL: 8.1-10.6 d). Approaches to ambiguous colors followed a generalization curve (81.0, 33.1, and 5.0 +/- 3.7% for near-positive, middle, and near-negative images, respectively), but not approaches to ambiguous shapes (31.9%, 25.7%, and 21.9% +/- 4.8%, respectively), indicating colors over shapes should be used in visual JBT for cattle. Part-time cows approached fewer ambiguous color images than full-time cows (23.5%, CL: 13.4%-34.4%; vs. 44.8%, CL; 32.8%-57.1%) whereas no-contact cows were intermediate, but not different from full-time or part-time cows (37.8%, CL; 26.8%-49.5%). The color JBT results show a pessimistic bias (indicating a negative emotional state) in cows with part-time calf contact, possibly due to repeated daily separation from her young calf, relative to cows with full-time calf contact. Thus, cow-calf contact systems appear to influence the emotional state of cows depending on the practice. Cows without calf contact showed no difference in judgment bias between cows with full- or part-time calf contact, suggesting these cows probably do not experience a pervasive negative emotional state (relative to those with calf contact) approximately 30 d after calf separation. However, individual variability in judgment bias was evident for all treatments. The visual judgment bias test is a useful methodology for assessing emotional states of dairy cows; future research should prioritize understanding the emotional states of dairy cows in alternative management systems.

The mainstream method of identifying cows through physical tags is somewhat invasive. This study introduces a non-invasive approach that utilizes overhead cameras to recognize cows without any physical contact. This method adapts well to changes in cow positions and partial obstructions and does not require system adjustments when new cows are introduced. By focusing on unique features in overhead images, this approach facilitates more convenient and effective monitoring and management of cows, assisting farm operators in achieving efficient daily farm operations.Abstract The automated recognition of individual cows is foundational for implementing intelligent farming. Traditional methods of individual cow recognition from an overhead perspective primarily rely on singular back features and perform poorly for cows with diverse orientation distributions and partial body visibility in the frame. This study proposes an open-set method for individual cow recognition based on spatial feature transformation and metric learning to address these issues. Initially, a spatial transformation deep feature extraction module, ResSTN, which incorporates preprocessing techniques, was designed to effectively address the low recognition rate caused by the diverse orientation distribution of individual cows. Subsequently, by constructing an open-set recognition framework that integrates three attention mechanisms, four loss functions, and four distance metric methods and exploring the impact of each component on recognition performance, this study achieves refined and optimized model configurations. Lastly, introducing moderate cropping and random occlusion strategies during the data-loading phase enhances the model's ability to recognize partially visible individuals. The method proposed in this study achieves a recognition accuracy of 94.58% in open-set scenarios for individual cows in overhead images, with an average accuracy improvement of 2.98 percentage points for cows with diverse orientation distributions, and also demonstrates an improved recognition performance for partially visible and randomly occluded individual cows. This validates the effectiveness of the proposed method in open-set recognition, showing significant potential for application in precision cattle farming management.

Increasing cow-calf contact poses challenges by reducing the machine milk yield and increasing separation stress. Part-time cow-calf contact may prove more feasible than full-time contact for farmers but may affect the maternal behavior of the cows. Gradually reducing the daily contact could gradually wean the calf off milk, preparing it for separation. This study aims to investigate (1) how cows' maternal behaviors toward their own calf are affected by part-time contact, and (2) whether calves' suckling behavior is reduced by reducing daily cow contact. Fifty-six dairy cows and their calves were assigned to either full-time (23 h/d) or part-time (10 h/d) cow-calf contact for 7 wk (main rearing period). This was followed by 2 wk of either reduced contact (50% in wk 8, then 25% of original contact time in wk 9) or unchanged contact. First, the maternal behavior of full- and part-time cows was observed for 24 h in the third week of the main rearing period. Part-time cows spent less time nursing and grooming their own calf than full-time cows did. However, the amount of nursing in the inverse parallel position and the probability of a cow nursing a calf other than her own did not differ between the 2 treatments. Second, calf suckling behavior was observed for 24 h in both weeks of the reduced contact period. Averaged across both observations, total suckling time (i.e., time spent suckling any cow) was lower in parttime calves that experienced reduced contact compared with part-time calves with unchanged contact. In wk 9, time spent suckling only the dam was lower for full-time calves with reduced contact compared with part-time calves with unchanged contact. In conclusion, although we found a lower nursing and grooming time in part-time cows compared with full-time, we found no difference between treatments with regard to nursing in the inverse parallel position and nursing a calf other than the cow's own. The effect of gradually reducing cow-calf contact on calves' suckling time requires more research.

However, it is unclear whether nutritional diarrhea develops as a result of gut acidosis and/or dysbiosis. This study aimed to uncover changes in the gastrointestinal microbiota and its fermentation parameters in response to nutritional diarrhea in postpartum dairy cows. Rumen and fecal samples were collected from twenty-four postpartum cows fed with the same diet but with different fecal scores: the low-fecal-score (LFS: diarrheic) group and high-fecal-score (HFS: non-diarrheic) group. A microbiota difference was only observed for fecal microbiota, with the relative abundance of Defluviitaleaceae_UCG-011 and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-001 tending (p < 0.10) to be higher in HFS cows compared to LFS cows, and Frisingicoccus were only detected in HFS cows. The fecal bacterial community in LFS cows had higher robustness (p < 0.05) compared to that in HFS cows, and also had lower negative cohesion (less competitive behaviors) and higher positive cohesion (more cooperative behaviors) (p < 0.05) compared that in to HFS cows. Lower total volatile fatty acids and higher ammonia nitrogen (p < 0.05) were observed in LFS cows' feces compared to HFS cows. The observed shift in fecal bacterial composition, community networks, and metabolites suggests that hindgut dysbiosis could be related to nutritional diarrhea in postpartum cows.

To fully utilize the existing multimodal data on farms and build a cow digital shadow with rich behavioral information, this study proposes a multimodal data fusion algorithm for recognizing cow behaviors such as drinking, feeding, lying, standing, and walking. This algorithm leverages the strengths of different data modalities, complementing each other, and enhances the performance of the cow behavior classification model. The algorithm integrates motion sensor and video data, collected by custom-made collars with inertial measurement units (IMUs) sensors placed at the top of the cow's neck and cameras in the barn, using EfficientNet V2 S, BiLSTM, and Transformer networks. Experimental results demonstrate recognition accuracies of 98.80 %, precision of 97.15 %, and recall rates of 96.93 %, showing significant improvements over single-modal data behavior recognition algorithms. This method maximizes the utility of existing multimodal data to generate a cow digital shadow with detailed behavioral information, enhancing the modeling and simulation element of the cow digital twin architecture and laying the foundation for developing a comprehensive cow behavior data model.

To better understand the relationship between gastrointestinal microbiota and mastitis in dairy cows, we collected blood, rumen fluid, and fecal samples from 23 dairy cows, including 13 cows with mastitis and 10 healthy cows. Using ELISA kit and high-throughput sequencing, we found that cows with mastitis had higher concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-1, and LPS than healthy cows (p < 0.05), but no significant differences in microbiota abundance or diversity (p > 0.05). Principal coordinate analysis (PCOA) revealed significant differences in rumen microbial structure between the two groups (p < 0.05), with Moryella as the signature for rumen in cows with mastitis. In contrast, fecal microbial structure showed no significant differences (p > 0.05), with Aeriscardovia, Lactococcus, and Bacillus as the signature for feces in healthy cows. Furthermore, the results showed distinct microbial interaction patterns in the rumen and feces of cows with mastitis compared to healthy cows. Additionally, we observed correlations between the microbiota in both the rumen and feces of cows and blood inflammatory indicators. Our study sheds new light on the prevention of mastitis in dairy cows by highlighting the relationship between gastrointestinal microbiota and mastitis.

To allow some cow -calf contact, part-time contact during the first weeks is thought to be a feasible solution, but it is unknown if it weakens maternal bond, i.e., if maternal motivation is lower. This study aimed to investigate how different amounts of calf contact (full-time, part-time, and no contact) affect cows' maternal motivation. Using pneumatic push gates, we assessed cows' motivation to access their own calf using the maximum price paid (MPP) method. To mitigate frustration at high prices, cows could also access an unfamiliar calf at a constant low price. We expected that cows would access the unfamiliar calf when reaching the maximum price that they were motivated to pay to access their own calf. Following 48 h in a calving pen, cow -calf pairs were allocated to three different treatments: full-time (23 h contact/d, 28 pairs), part-time (10 h contact/d, 27 pairs), and no contact (0 h contact/d, 26 pairs). Approximately 40 d after calving, cows were trained to pass through each of two push gates: one leading to their own and one leading to an unfamiliar calf. The weight on the gate leading to the cows' own calf increased following each passing, while the gate leading to the unfamiliar calf remained light. Cows were tested once daily, until they failed to pass through the gate leading to their own calf on two consecutive days. MPP was analysed using a Cox's proportional hazards mixed effects model. Fewer nocontact cows than full- and part-time cows fulfilled the learning criteria. Furthermore, no -contact cows paid a lower maximum price compared to the two contact treatments, while the MPP of full- and part-time cows did not differ. Most cows remained in the start box if they did not pass the gate to their own calf, indicating that an unfamiliar calf could not substitute for their own calf at high prices. We conclude that cows with part-time calf contact form a maternal bond of similar strength to cows with full-time calf contact. Additionally, cows separated from their calf at 48 h after calving have a weaker maternal motivation at 40 days postpartum.

Microbial composition, rumen fermentation parameters, enteric methane emissions, and lactational performance of phenotypically high and low methane-emitting dairy cows	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						phenotype; methane; ruminal fermentation; microbiome; host genetics	RETENTION TIME; DIGESTA; YIELD; SHEEP; DIGESTIBILITY; MITIGATION; EFFICIENCY; ALIGNMENT; MARKERS; TRAITS	This experiment was designed to investigate the relation of high and low methane-yield phenotypes with body weight (BW), dry matter intake (DMI), lactation performance, enteric CH4 emissions, and rumen fermentation parameters in lactating dairy cows. A total of 130 multi-and primiparous Holstein cows were screened for enteric CH4 emissions using the GreenFeed system (C-Lock Inc.). Out of these 130 cows, 5 were identified as phenotypically high (HM) and 5 as phenotypically low (LM) CH4 emitters. Cows in the LM group had lower daily enteric CH4 emissions than cows in the HM group (on average 346 vs. 439 g/d, respectively), lower CH4 yield (15.5 vs. 20.4 g of CH4/kg of DMI), and CH4 intensity (13.2 vs. 17.0 g of CH4/ kg of energy-corrected milk yield). Enteric emissions of CO2 and H2 did not differ between HM and LM cows. These 10 cows were blocked by parity, days in milk, and milk production, and were used in a 5-wk randomized complete block design experiment. Milk composition, production, and BW were also not different between LM and HM cows. The concentration of total volatile fatty acids in ruminal contents did not differ between CH4 phenotypes, but LM cows had a lower molar proportion of acetate (57 vs. 62.1%), a higher proportion of propionate (27.5 vs. 21.6%, respectively), and therefore a lower acetate-to-propionate ratio than HM cows. Consistently, the 16S cDNA analysis revealed the abundance of Succinivibrionaceae and unclassified Veillonellaceae to be higher in LM cows compared with HM cows, bacteria that were positively correlated with ruminal propionate concentration. Notably, Succinivibrionaceae trigger the formation of propionate via oxaloacetate pathway from phosphoenolpyruvate via Enzyme Commission: 4.1.1.49, which showed a trend to be higher in LM cows compared with HM cows. Additionally, LM cows possessed fewer transcripts of a gene encoding for methyl-CoM reductase enzyme compared with HM. In this study, low and high CH4-yield cows have similar production performance and milk composition, but total-tract apparent digestibility of organic matter and fiber fractions was lower in the former group of animals.

Danish Holstein dairy cows were assigned to 1 of 3 cow-calf contact treatments: full-time with the calf (n = 24), part-time with the calf between morning (a.m.) and afternoon (p.m.) milking and separated overnight (n = 23), or separated from the calf at birth (n = 23). Behavior of cows (stepping and kicking in the parlor) and milking procedures (teat or udder stimulation frequency, preparation duration) were recorded at a.m. and p.m. milking on 2 d during wk 4 and 6 of the treatment period (8 milkings per cow). Full-time cows had the lowest machine milk yields (mean f SE; 6.1 and 6.0 f 0.7 L at a.m. and p.m. milking, respectively), whereas part-time cows had similar yield to no-contact cows at a.m. milking (19.6 f 0.7 L) and similar yield to full-time cows at p.m. milking (6.4 f 0.7 L). Lower machine milk yields in cows with calf contact could not be fully attributed to milk consumption by the calf; however, they also could not be explained by differences in cow parity, calf sex, milking procedures (stimulation frequency; preparation duration), or stepping and kicking (restless) behavior at milking. All cows showed more restless behavior at p.m. milking, which weakly negatively affected machine milk yield, but this was unrelated to stimulation frequency in cow-calf contact cows, indicating that there may be other sources of discomfort or stress at the time of milking for these cows. Part-time versus full-time calf contact improved daily machine milk yields, but low machine milk yield issues merit further research so that cow-calf contact systems can be sustainable for producers.

There is a need to improve the detection rate of cow estrus and to reduce the emergency response caused by wearing contact devices. Furthermore, it is necessary to verify the practical effectiveness of the LOGISITC and SV (support vector machine) models for modeling cow estrus. In this paper, we have proposed a non-contact cow estrus monitoring method based on the thermal infrared images of cows and have proposed a lab-color-space-based feature extraction method for the thermal infrared images of cow eyes and vulvas. The test subjects were 10 Holstein cows, monitored on a fixed basis, to determine the best segmentation contour. The LOGISTIC and SVM (support vector machine) models were used to establish the cow estrus model using the thermal infrared temperature variation in cows in estrus and cows not in estrus. The experimental results showed that the heat detection rate of the LOGISTIC-based model was 82.37% and the heat detection rate of the SVM-based model was 81.42% under the optimal segmentation profile. The highest temperature in the eye and vulva of cows was the input, and the recall rate was above 86%. The heat monitoring method based on thermal infrared images does not cause stress to cows and meets the needs of modern dairy farming for welfare breeding.

A total of 84 lactating dairy cows (Holsteins, Jerseys, and crossbreeds) from a commercial dairy farm in Central Texas were randomly selected and enrolled in this study from October 2023 to February 2024. Cows (60 +/- 7 DIM) were enrolled in cohorts weekly for five weeks and were randomly fitted with an IceQube pedometer (IceRobotics, Edinburgh, UK) to track lying time. Lameness and body condition scores (BCS) were recorded, and blood samples were collected once a week. Parameters of reproductive performance included insemination rate, conception rate, pregnancy rate, and the CCI. Monthly dairy herd improvement association (DHIA) testing included milk yield and MUN concentrations. Breed and lactation number had a significant effect on milk yield, MUN concentration, lying time, BCS, and lameness (p < 0.001). Lactation number had a significant effect on P-4 concentrations (p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between lameness and milk yield (p = 0.014) and a negative correlation between lameness and MUN concentrations (p = 0.038).

Gradual weaning of 3-month-old calves from foster cows in dairy production	JDS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SUCKLING BEHAVIOR; NURSE COWS; SEPARATION; CONTACT; GROWTH	This study investigated the effect of gradually weaning 3-month-old calves reared by foster cows. One week before weaning was initiated, the calves spent a similar amount of time sucking their designated foster cow and other cows. During gradual weaning, cows were removed, one by one, from the cow-calf group. Removing the designated foster cow reduced the calves' total time spent suckling, but calves received more aggression from other cows. Thus, calves intensified suckling of the foster cows left in the cow-calf group. This may compromise the welfare of both younger and lighter calves, as well as the cows left to wean off more and more calves.

Targeted reproductive management for lactating Holstein cows: Reducing the reliance on exogenous reproductive hormones	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						early postpartum; Holstein cow; reproduction; automated estrus detection	TIMED ARTIFICIAL-INSEMINATION; ACTIVITY MONITORING-SYSTEM; DAIRY-COWS; DOUBLE-OVSYNCH; ESTROUS EXPRESSION; ESTRUS DETECTION; PERFORMANCE; FERTILITY; PRESYNCHRONIZATION; MILK	Adoption of automated monitoring devices (AMD) affords the opportunity to tailor reproductive manage-ment according to the cow's needs. We hypothesized that a targeted reproductive management (TRM) would reduce the use of reproductive hormones while increasing the percentage of cows pregnant 305 d in milk (DIM). Holstein cows from 2 herds (n = 1,930) were fitted with an AMD at 251.0 & PLUSMN; 0.4 d of gesta-tion. Early-postpartum estrus characteristics (EPEC; intense estrus = heat index & GE;70; 0 = minimum, 100 = maximum) of multiparous cows were evaluated at 40 (herd 1) or 41 (herd 2) DIM and EPEC of primiparous cows were evaluated at 54 (herd 1) or 55 (herd 2) DIM. Control cows received the first artificial insemination at fixed time (TAI; primiparous, herd 1 = 82 and herd 2 = 83 DIM; multiparous, herd 1 = 68 and herd 2 = 69 DIM) following the Double-Ovsynch (DOV) protocol. Cows enrolled in the TRM treatment were managed as follows: (1) cows with at least one intense estrus were inseminated upon AMD detected estrus for 42 d and, if not inseminated, were enrolled in the DOV protocol; and (2) cows without an intense estrus were enrolled in the DOV protocol at the same time as cows in the con-trol treatment. Control cows were re-inseminated based on visual or patch aided detection of estrus, whereas TRM cows were re-inseminated as described for control cows with the aid of the AMD. Cows received a GnRH injection 27 & PLUSMN; 3 d after insemination and, if diagnosed as nonpregnant, completed the 5-d Cosynch protocol and received TAI 35 & PLUSMN; 3 d after insemination. Among cows in the TRM treatment, 55.8 and 42.9% of primip-arous and multiparous cows, respectively, received the first insemination in spontaneous estrus. The interac-tion between treatment and parity affected pregnancy 67 d after the first AI (primiparous: control = 37.6%, TRM = 27.4%; multiparous: control = 41.0%, TRM = 44.7%). The TRM treatment increased re-insemination in estrus (control = 48.3%, TRM = 70.5%). Pregnancy 67 d after re-inseminations tended to be affected by the interaction between treatment and EPEC (no intense estrus: control = 25.3%, TRM = 32.0%; intense es-trus: control = 32.9%, TRM = 32.2%). The interaction between treatment and EPEC affected pregnancy by 305 DIM (no intense estrus: control = 80.8%, TRM = 88.2%; intense estrus: control = 87.1%, TRM = 86.1%). Treatment did not affect the number of reproductive hormone treatments among cows that had not had an intense estrus (control = 10.5 & PLUSMN; 0.3, TRM = 9.1 & PLUSMN; 0.2 treatments/cow), but cows in the TRM treatment that had an intense estrus received fewer reproductive hormone treatments than cows in the control treatment (2.0 & PLUSMN; 0.1 vs. 9.6 & PLUSMN; 0.2 treatments/cow). Selecting multiparous cows for first AI in estrus based on EPEC reduced the use of reproductive hormones without im-pairing the likelihood of pregnancy to first AI. The use of AMD for re-insemination expedited the establish-ment of pregnancy among cows that did not display an intense estrus early postpartum.

Effect of transition cow health and estrous expression detected by an automated activity monitoring system within 60 days in milk on reproductive performance of lactating Holstein cows	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						estrous expression; automated activity monitoring; transition cow health; reproductive performance	RISK-FACTORS; POSTPARTUM OVULATION; FERTILITY; ASSOCIATION; ANOVULATION; PREVALENCE; SURVIVAL; DISEASES; OUTCOMES	The objective of this observational study was to evaluate the association of transition cow health and estrous expression, detected by an automated activ-ity monitoring system (Smarttag Neck, Nedap Live-stock Management), with reproductive performance in lactating Holstein cows. A total of 3,750 lactat-ing Holstein cows (1,563 primiparous cows and 2,187 multiparous cows) from a commercial dairy farm in Slovakia calving from January 2020 until July 2021 were enrolled on an ongoing basis. Activity data were recorded from d 7 until d 60 postpartum. Within this observational period, cows were classified into 3 cate-gories: (1) no estrus event (Estrus0), (2) 1 estrus event (Estrus1), or (3) 2 or more estrus events (Estrus2+). Transition cow health was assessed by farm personnel within the first 30 d in milk (DIM) using standard operating procedures. Generalized linear mixed mod-els were used to analyze continuous and categorical data. Cox proportional hazard models were used for time to event data. The overall prevalence of anes-trus was 20.8%. Multiparous cows had a greater risk for anestrus compared with primiparous cows [odds ratio (OR) = 1.4]. Cows with stillbirth (OR = 1.76), retained placenta (OR = 2.19), puerperal metritis (OR = 1.48), or subclinical ketosis (OR = 1.51) had a greater risk for anestrus. In addition, cows calving in summer (OR = 0.82), autumn (OR = 0.38), or winter (OR = 0.56) had a higher incidence of anestrus than cows calving in spring. Estrous expression from d 7 until d 60 postpartum was associated with estrous duration (DU) and estrous intensity at first artificial insemination (AI). Cows in Estrus0 had the shortest DU at first postpartum AI (9.4 +/- 0.18 h) compared with cows in Estrus1 (10.5 +/- 0.13 h) and Estrus2+(11.4 +/- 0.12 h). Cows in Estrus2+ had a longer DU at first postpartum AI compared with cows in Estrus1. For Estrus0, Estrus1, and Estrus2+ cows, pregnancy per AI at first service was 42.5%, 50.9%, and 55.4%, respectively. Estrous expression from d 7 until d 60 postpartum was associated with time to first AI and time to pregnancy. Compared with Estrus0 cows, Es-trus1 [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.43] and Estrus2+ cows (HR = 1.62) had an increased hazard of being insemi-nated within 100 DIM. Compared with Estrus2+, Es-trus1 cows had a reduced hazard of being inseminated within 100 DIM (HR = 0.89). Compared with Estrus0 cows, Estrus1 (HR = 1.24) and Estrus2+ cows (HR = 1.46) had an increased hazard of becoming pregnant within 200 DIM. Median DIM to pregnancy were 121, 96, and 92 for Estrus0, Estrus1, and Estrus2+ cows, respectively. In conclusion, cows with transition cow disorders (i.e., stillbirth, retained placenta, puerperal metritis, or subclinical ketosis) had a greater chance for anestrus compared with healthy cows. Cows in Estrus0 had reduced estrous expression at first AI and inferior reproductive performance compared with cows that displayed estrous activity from d 7 until d 60.	[Bretzinger, L.

Milk samples were taken from Holstein-Friesian cows from four dairy farms in Lublin Province. The bacteriological examination of the milk was performed and the somatic cells count in 1 mL of milk was determined using a SomaCount FC automatic cell counter. Determination of TP, CAS, LAC, FAT and FA levels in milk was carried out using a DairySpec FT automated Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Results: Total protein in milk from HE was significantly higher than in milk from cows with mastitis (4.04% vs 3.57% in milk from SCM cows and 3.7% in milk from CM cows, P = 0.001). The CAS level was 2.73% in milk from CM cows and 2.92% in milk from SCM cows vs 3.30% in milk from HE cows, P = 0.001. The changes in CAS and TP in milk resulted in a significant difference in the CAS/TP ratio (81.7% in milk from HE cows vs 73.8% in milk from CM cows). A decrease in levels was also recorded for LAC (4.8% in milk from HE cows vs 4.51% in milk from SCM cows and 4.01% in milk from CM cows, P = 0.001). The fat level was significantly higher in milk from healthy cows than in milk from cows with mastitis (4.0% vs 2.3% in milk from SCM cows and 1.64% in milk from CM cows, P = 0.001). Conclusion: It should be emphasised that the decrease in the levels of TP, LAC and FAT was significant not only in milk from CM cows but also in milk from SCM cows. This is very unfavourable, because the reduction in the main milk components results in poor quality dairy products and impairs line processes.

Cow characteristics associated with the variation in number of contacts between dairy cows	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						dairy cow; real-time location system; social interactions	BEHAVIORAL-CHANGES; SOCIAL NETWORK; STOCKING DENSITY; TIME-BUDGETS; ESTRUS; CATTLE; INTERPOLATION; LAMENESS; DISEASE; PERIOD	In modern freestall barns where large groups of cows are housed together, the behavior displayed by herd mates can influence the welfare and production of other individuals. Therefore, understanding social interac-tions in groups of dairy cows is important to enhance herd management and optimize the outcomes of both animal health and welfare in the future. Many factors can affect the number of social contacts in a group. This study aimed to identify which characteristics of a cow are associated with the number of contacts it has with other group members in 2 different functional areas (feeding and resting area) to increase our under-standing of the social behavior of dairy cows. Inside 2 herds housed in freestall barns with around 200 lactat-ing cows each, cow positions were recorded with an ultra-wideband real-time location system collecting all cows' positions every second over 2 wk. Using the posi-tioning data of the cows, we quantified the number of contacts between them, assuming that cows spending time in proximity to one another (within a distance of 2.5 m for at least 10 min per day) were interact-ing socially. We documented in which barn areas these interactions occurred and used linear mixed models to investigate if lactation stage, parity, breed, pregnancy status, estrus, udder health, and claw health affect the number of contacts. We found variation in the num-ber of contacts a cow had between individuals in both functional areas. Cows in later lactation had more con-tacts in the feeding area than cows in early lactation. Furthermore, in one herd, higher parity cows had fewer contacts in the feeding area than first parity cows, and in the other herd, cows in third parity or higher had more contacts in the resting area. This study indicates that cow characteristics such as parity and days in milk are associated with the number of contacts a cow has daily to its herd mates and provides useful information for further research on social interactions of dairy cows.

One important aspect of such a system is the ability to identify individual cows and estimate their feeding time. In this study, we propose a method for achieving this goal through facial region analysis. We used a YOLO detector to extract the cow head region from video images captured during feeding with the head region cropped as a face region image. The face region image was used for cow identification and transfer learning was employed for identification. In the context of cow identification, transfer learning can be used to train a pre-existing deep neural network to recognize individual cows based on their unique physical characteristics, such as their head shape, markings, or ear tags. To estimate the time of feeding, we divided the feeding area into vertical strips for each cow and established a horizontal line just above the feeding materials to determine whether a cow was feeding or not by using Hough transform techniques. We tested our method using real-life data from a large farm, and the experimental results showed promise in achieving our objectives. This approach has the potential to diagnose diseases and movement disorders in cows and could provide valuable insights for farmers.

Association of activity and subsequent fertility of dairy cows after spontaneous estrus or timed artificial insemination	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						estrous expression; automated activity monitor; timed artificial insemination; pregnancy per artificial insemination	GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING-HORMONE; SEX-SORTED SPERM; HEAT-STRESS; ESTRADIOL CYPIONATE; ESTROUS BEHAVIOR; OVSYNCH PROTOCOL; FOLLICULAR DEVELOPMENT; PREGNANCY OUTCOMES; ACTIVITY MONITORS; HOLSTEIN HEIFERS	The objective of this observational study was to evaluate the association between increased physical activity at first artificial insemination (AI) and subsequent pregnancy per AI (P/AI) in lactating Holstein cows following spontaneous estrus or a timed AI (TAI) protocol. We also wanted to identify factors associated with the intensity of activity increase (PA) captured by automated activity monitors (AAM) and fertility. Two experiments were conducted, in which cows either were inseminated based on the alert of the AAM system (AAM cows) or received TAI following a 7-d Ovsynch protocol (TAI cows) if not inseminated within a farm-specific period after calving. Experiment 1 included 2,698 AI services from AAM cows and 1,042 AI services from TAI cows equipped with the Smart tag Neck (Nedap Livestock Management) from a dairy farm in Slovakia (farm 1). In the second experiment, 6,517 AI services from AAM cows and 1,226 AI services from TAI cows fitted with Heatime (Heatime Pro; SCR Engineers Ltd.) from 8 dairy farms in Germany (farms 2-9) were included. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed on a weekly basis by transrectal ultrasound (farms 1, 3, 7, 8) or by transrectal palpation (farms 2, 4-6, 9). Estrous intensity was represented by the peak value of the change in activity. In experiment 1, PA was categorized into low (x-factor 0-20) and high (x-factor 21-100) PA, and in experiment 2 into low (activity change = 35-89) and high (activity change = 90-100) PA. In TAI cows from both experiments, PA was additionally categorized into cows with no AAM alert. Data were analyzed separately for AAM and TAI cows using multinomial logistic regression models for PA in TAI cows and logistic regression models for PA in AAM cows and P/AI in both groups. In experiment 1, P/AI of AAM cows was greater for AI services performed with conventional frozen semen (57.6%) compared with sexed semen (47.2%), whereas type of semen only tended to be associated with P/AI in TAI cows (54.4% conventional frozen semen vs. 48.9% sexed semen). In experiment 2, P/AI was greater for fresh semen (AAM cows: 44.4% vs. TAI cows: 44.2%) compared with conventional frozen semen (AAM cows: 37.6% vs. TAI cows: 34.6%). In both experiments, pregnancy out-comes were associated with PA. In experiment 1, AAM cows with high PA (55.1%) had greater P/AI than cows with low PA (49.8%). Within TAI cows, cows with no alert (38.8%) had reduced P/AI compared with cows with low (54.2%) or high PA (61.8%). In experiment 2, AAM cows with high PA (45.8%) had greater P/ AI compared with cows with low PA (36.4%). Timed AI cows with no alert (27.4%) had decreased P/AI compared with cows with low (41.1%) or high (50.8%) PA. The greatest risk factors for high PA were parity (experiment 1) and season of AI (except for TAI cows from experiment 1). We conclude that high PA at the time of AI is associated with greater odds of pregnancy for both AAM and TAI cows. In both experiments, about 2 thirds of AAM cows (experiment 1: 69.9% and experiment 2: 70.7%) reached high PA, whereas only approximately one-third or less of TAI cows (experi-ment 1: 37.3% and experiment 2: 23.6%) showed high PA. Although we observed similar results using 2 dif-ferent AAM systems for the most part, risk factors for high PA might differ between farms and insemination type (i.e., AAM vs. TAI).	[Tippenhauer, C.

Increased incidence of reproductive disorders associated with short gestation length in Holstein dairy cows	THERIOGENOLOGY			English	Article						Gestation length; Holstein; Parity; Production; Reproductive diseases	POSTPARTUM UTERINE DISEASE; RETAINED PLACENTA; HEAT-STRESS; PERFORMANCE; DYSTOCIA; STILLBIRTH; CONSEQUENCES; PREGNANCY; METRITIS; HEALTH	The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of gestation length (GL) on productive performance, and the incidence of calving and reproductive diseases in Holstein dairy cows. In total, 3800 Holstein singleton cows (2000 heifers and 1800 cows) from two commercial dairy farms were used. The average gestation length for 3800 cows was 276 +/- 6 d. Cows with GL shorter or longer than 3 SD from the mean were removed and considered outliers. This process led to the elimination of 20 cows from the 3800 cows enrolled in the study. Therefore, 3780 cows (1994 heifers and 1786 cows) remained for data analysis, with a range of GL between 258 and 294 d. The mean of GL for the remaining 3780 cows in the study was 276 +/- 5 d, which were classified as short (SGL; more than 1SD less than the population mean, mean = 267, range 258-270 d), average (AGL; population mean +/- 1SD, mean = 276, range 271 -281 d), and long (LGL; more than 1SD greater than the population mean, mean = 284, range 282 -294 d) gestation length. In primiparous cows, the incidence of stillbirth, retained placenta, metritis, and clinical endometritis were higher in the SGL cows than in the AGL cows, but the incidence of dystocia was similar across groups. In multiparous cows, the incidence of dystocia, retained placenta, and metritis were higher in the SGL cows than in the AGL cows, and the incidence of stillbirth was higher in the SGL and LGL cows than in the AGL cows. In primiparous cows, milk yield was not different across groups. However, in multiparous cows, the SGL cows had lower milk yield than the AGL cows. In primiparous cows, the SGL cows had lower colostrum production than the AGL cows, but in multiparous cows, there was no difference in colostrum production across groups. In general, cows with either short or long gestation length had impaired health and production, but this impact was more pronounced in cows with short gestation length.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Fertility and survival of Swedish Red and White ? Holstein crossbred cows and purebred Holstein cows	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						crossbreeding; fertility; survival	MONTBELIARDE X HOLSTEIN; DAIRY-CATTLE; REPRODUCTIVE-PERFORMANCE; SHORT-COMMUNICATION; PRODUCTIVE LIFE; MILK-PRODUCTION; 1ST LACTATION; VIKING RED; SELECTION; NORMANDE	Swedish Red and White x Holstein (SxH) cows were compared with pure Holstein (HOL) cows for fertil-ity and survival traits in 2 commercial dairy farms in central-southern Cordoba province, Argentina, over 6 years (2008-2013). The following traits were evaluated: first service conception rate (FSCR), overall concep-tion rate (CR), number of services per conception (SC), days open (DO), mortality rate, culling rate, survival to subsequent calvings, and length of productive life (LPL). The data set consisted of 506 lactations from 240 SxH crossbred cows and 1,331 lactations from 576 HOL cows. The FSCR and CR were analyzed using logistic regression, DO and LPL were analyzed using a Cox's proportional hazards regression model, and dif-ferences of proportions were calculated for mortality rate, culling rate, and survival to subsequent calvings. The SxH cows were superior to HOL cows in overall lactations for all the fertility traits (+10.5% FSCR, +7.7% CR, -0.5 SC, and 35 fewer DO). During the first lactation, SxH cows were superior to HOL cows for all fertility traits (+12.8% FSCR, +8.0% CR, -0.4 SC, and 34 fewer DO). In the second lactation, SxH cows exhibited lower SC (-0.5) and 21 fewer DO than HOL cows. In the third or greater lactations, SxH cows showed higher FSCR (+11.0%) and CR (+12.2%), lower SC (-0.8), and 44 fewer DO than pure HOL cows. In addition, SxH cows had a lower mortality rate (-4.7%) and a lower culling rate (-13.7%) than HOL cows. Due to the higher fertility and lower mortality and culling rates, the SxH cows had higher survival to the second (+9.2%), third (+16.9%), and fourth (+18.7%) calvings than HOL cows. Because of these results, SxH cows had longer LPL (+10.3 mo) than HOL cows. These results indicate that SxH cows had higher fertility and survival than HOL cows on com-mercial dairy farms in Argentina.	[Pipino, D. F.; Vazquez, M.

Effects of fresh-cow grouping strategy and rumen-protected glucose on production performance, reproductive variables and risk of culling in Holstein cows	VETERINARY MEDICINE AND SCIENCE			English	Article						glucose; grouping strategy; lactation; milk composition; postpartum cow	DAIRY-COWS; MILK-PRODUCTION; ARTIFICIAL-INSEMINATION; PLASMA-CONCENTRATIONS; TRANSITION PERIOD; GUT PEPTIDES; INFUSION; METABOLISM; LACTATION; SYSTEM	BackgroundThe interaction effects of duration of stay in fresh-cow diet and supplementation with rumen-protected glucose (RPG) on productivity of dairy cows are largely unknown. We hypothesised that a faster transition from fresh-cow diet (higher forage:concentrate) to lactation-cow diet (lower forage:concentrate), combined with supplementation of fresh-cow diet with RPG will have positive effects on production and health of dairy cows. ObjectivesTo investigate the immediate and long-term effects of length of stay in fresh-cow diet and supplementation with RPG on productive and reproductive performance of high-producing dairy cows. MethodsA total of 264 multiparous Holstein cows (average parity +/- standard deviation = 3.2 +/- 1.3, ranging from 2 to 6) were used in a 2 x 2 factorially arranged trial. Treatments were the feeding duration of a fresh-cow diet for 14 or 21 days, each combined by daily supplementation of the fresh-cow diet with ground corn grain or RPG product top dressed at 500 g/day/head. ResultsThe earlier transition from fresh-cow to lactation diet resulted in greater milk production from 15 through 21 days in milk (DIM; by 2.28 kg/day), and also fat-corrected milk production on 30 and 60 DIM, respectively. Corn grain or RPG supplementation did not affect the average milk production (1 to 21 DIM), as well as milk production and composition on 30 and 60 DIM. Although extent of body condition loss at transition tended to be lesser in cows switching faster to lactation diet, these cows lost more body condition from 30 to 90 DIM. Survival analysis on calving-to-conception interval and time to removal from herd did not find any significant difference across treatments. ConclusionsThe positive effects of earlier transition from fresh-cow to lactation diet were evident by greater milk production from 15 through 21 DIM, and fat-corrected milk production (30 and 60 DIM), at the expense of body condition in high-producing dairy cows. A daily topdress of RPG on fresh-cow diet had no immediate or carryover effects on production of dairy cows.

J	Russello, H; Tol, RV; Kootstra, G				Russello, Helena; Tol, Rik van der; Kootstra, Gert			T-LEAP: Occlusion-robust pose estimation of walking cows using temporal information	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Cattle; Gait; Temporal; Pose estimation; Deep learning; Occlusion	KINEMATIC MEASURES; DAIRY-COWS	As herd size on dairy farms continues to increase, automatic health monitoring of cows is gaining in interest. Lameness, a prevalent health disorder in dairy cows, is commonly detected by analyzing the gait of cows. A cow's gait can be tracked in videos using pose estimation models because models learn to automatically localize anatomical landmarks in images and videos. Most animal pose estimation models are static, that is, videos are processed frame by frame and do not use any temporal information. In this work, a static deep-learning model for animal-pose-estimation was extended to a temporal model that includes information from past frames. We compared the performance of the static and temporal pose estimation models. The data consisted of 1059 samples of 4 consecutive frames extracted from videos (30 fps) of 30 different dairy cows walking through an outdoor passageway. As farm environments are prone to occlusions, we tested the robustness of the static and temporal models by adding artificial occlusions to the videos. The experiments showed that, on non-occluded data, both static and temporal approaches achieved a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCKh@0.2) of 99%. On occluded data, our temporal approach outperformed the static one by up to 32.9%, suggesting that using temporal data was beneficial for pose estimation in environments prone to occlusions, such as dairy farms. The generalization capabilities of the temporal model was evaluated by testing it on data containing unknown cows (cows not present in the training set). The results showed that the average PCKh@0.2 was of 93.8% on known cows and 87.6% on unknown cows, indicating that the model was capable of generalizing well to new cows and that they could be easily fine-tuned to new herds. Finally, we showed that with harder tasks, such as occlusions and unknown cows, a deeper architecture was more beneficial.

Cows suffering from different types of infertility such as endometritis, anestrus, silent estrus and cows showing metestrual bleeding were evaluated and compared with normal cyclic and pregnant cows. Minerals evaluated were calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, copper, zinc, sodium, and potassium. The levels of calcium were statistically low in anestrus and silent estrus cows when compared with normal cyclic and pregnant animals. The levels of phosphorus were significantly low in cows suffering from endometritis and in cows showing abnormal metestrual bleeding in comparison to normal cyclic cows. Similarly, magnesium levels were high in pregnant cows than other categories. Copper was statistically high in normal cyclic and pregnant cows. Similarly, sodium and potassium were statistically high in normal cyclic cows than infertile and repeat breeder cows.

Assessment of the main pathogens associated with clinical and subclinical endometritis in cows by culture and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identification	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						analyses; clinical endometritis; subclinical endometritis; uterine microbiota; dairy cow; matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry	POSTPARTUM UTERINE DISEASE; PURULENT VAGINAL DISCHARGE; DAIRY-COWS; REPRODUCTIVE-PERFORMANCE; TRUEPERELLA-PYOGENES; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; DYNAMICS; CYTOLOGY; PREVALENCE; MICROBIOTA	Clinical endometritis (CE) and subclinical endometritis (SCE) are diseases that affect dairy cows during the puerperium, causing negative effects on the animals' milk production and fertility. The objective of this study was to assess the main bacteria related to cases of CE and SCE from uterine samples of dairy cows in Brazilian herds. Selective and differential media were used for isolation of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and further MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) identification. A total of 279 lactating dairy cows with 28 to 33 d in milk from 6 commercial farms were evaluated. Initially, cows were classified in 3 groups: cytologic healthy cows (n = 161), cows with CE (n = 83), and cows with SCE (n = 35). Healthy animals presented 97 species, followed by the CE group with 53 identified species, and SCE cows presented only 21 bacterial species. We found a significantly higher isolation rate of Trueperella pyogenes in CE (26.5%) cows compared with healthy and SCE cows. Some anaerobic species were exclusively isolated from the CE group, even though they presented lower frequency. Interestingly, 18.1% of samples from CE cows and 40% of SCE cows were negative to bacterial isolation. Despite the use of culture-dependent methods instead of molecular methods, the present study enabled the identification of a complex community of 127 different species from 48 genera, composed of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species among the 3 different animal groups. The method of sample collection, culture, and identification by MALDI-TOF MS were essential for the success of the analyses.	[Paiano, R. B.; Pugliesi, G.; Baruselli, P.

Influence of body condition score and its change after parturition on pregnancy rates to fixed-timed artificial insemination in Bos indicus beef cows	ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						Beef cows; Body condition score; Fixed -time artificial insemination; Pregnancy	REPRODUCTIVE-PERFORMANCE; POSTPARTUM NUTRITION; ENDOCRINE FUNCTION; METABOLIC STATUS; PROGESTERONE; STRATEGIES; INSULIN; HEIFERS; OVARIAN; CATTLE	This experiment evaluated pregnancy rates to fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) in Bos indicus beef cows according to their body condition score (BCS) at calving and subsequent change until 30 days after FTAI. Non-pregnant, suckling Nelore cows (n = 593 primiparous, 461 secundiparous, and 893 multiparous) were evaluated for BCS at calving and FTAI, and at 30 days after FTAI when cow pregnancy status was verified. Cow BCS at calving was subtracted from BCS recorded at pregnancy diagnosis, and cows classified as those that lost BCS (L), maintained BCS (M), or gained BCS (G) during this period. Cows that calved with BCS >= 5.0 had greater (P < 0.01) BCS throughout the experiment, and greater (P < 0.01) pregnancy rates to FTAI compared with cows that calved with BCS < 5.0 (54.8 vs. 34.2%). Pregnancy rates to FTAI were greater (P < 0.01) for G and M cows compared with L cows (50.0%, 47.5%, and 36.0%, respectively), and similar (P = 0.46) between G and M cows. Moreover, pregnancy rates to FTAI in G cows that calved with BCS < 5.0 were less compared with L (tendency; P = 0.08) and M cows (P < 0.01) that calved with BCS >= 5.0 (42.2%, 48.3%, and 58.3%, respectively). In summary, pregnancy rates to FTAI were greater in B. indicus cows that calved with a BCS >= 5.0 regardless of parity and post-calving BCS change, and greater in M and G cows within those that calved with BCS < 5.0 or >= 5.0.

Novel insights into heat tolerance using metabolomic and high-throughput sequencing analysis in dairy cows rumen fluid	ANIMAL			English	Article						Bacteria; Heat resistance; Holstein; Rumen fermentation; Metabolism	MILK-PRODUCTION; STRESS; FAT; FERMENTATION; BIOMARKERS; REVEALS; LOSSES; CATTLE; DIET; HOT	Heat stress influences rumen fermentative processes with effects on the physiology and production of dairy cows. However, the underlying relationship between rumen microbiota and its associated metabolism with heat tolerance in cows have not been extensively described yet. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate differential heat resistance in Holstein cows using rumen bacterial and metabolome analyses. We performed both principal component analysis and membership function analysis to select seven heat-tolerant (HT) and seven heat-sensitive (HS) cows. Under heat stress conditions, the HT cows had a significantly (P < 0.05) higher propionic acid content than the HS cows; while measures of the respiratory rate, acetic, and butyric acid in the HT cows were significantly (P < 0.05) lower compared with the HS cows. Also, the HT cows showed lower (P < 0.01) rectal temperature and acetic acid to propionic acid ratio than the HS group of cows. Omics sequencing revealed that the relative abundances of Muribaculaceae, Rikenellaceae, Acidaminococcaceae, Christensenellaceae, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Succiniclasticum, Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group were significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the HT cows; whereas Prevotellaceae, Prevotella_1, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, and Shuttleworthia were significantly (P < 0.01) lower in HT cows compared to HS cows. Substances mainly involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including glycerol, mannitol, and maltose, showed significantly higher content in the HT cows (P < 0.05) compared to that in the HS cows. Simultaneously, distinct metabolites were significantly correlated with differential bacteria, suggesting that glycerol, mannitol, and maltose could serve as potential biomarkers for determining heat resistance that require further study.
