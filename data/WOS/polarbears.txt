Telemetry without collars: performance of fur- and ear-mounted satellite tags for evaluating the movement and behaviour of polar bears	ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY			English	Article						Telemetry; Fur tag; Hair tag; Polar bear; Ursus maritimus	SOUTHERN BEAUFORT SEA; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; ICE-FREE PERIOD; URSUS-MARITIMUS; HUDSON-BAY; ANIMAL MOVEMENT; JAMES BAY; PATTERNS; SUMMER; IMMOBILIZATION	The study of animal movement provides insights into underlying ecological processes and informs analyses of behaviour and resource use, which have implications for species management and conservation. The tools used to study animal movement have evolved over the past decades, allowing for data collection from a variety of species, including those living in remote environments. Satellite-linked radio and GPS collars have been used to study polar bear (Ursus maritimus) ecology and movements throughout the circumpolar Arctic for over 50 years. However, due to morphology and growth constraints, only adult female polar bears can be reliably collared. Collars have proven to be safe, but there has been opposition to their use, resulting in a deficiency in data across much of the species' range. To bolster knowledge of movement characteristics and behaviours for polar bears other than adult females, while also providing an alternative to collars, we tested the use of fur- and ear-mounted telemetry tags that can be affixed to polar bears of any sex and age. We tested three fur tag designs (SeaTrkr, tribrush and pentagon tags), which we affixed to 15 adult and 1 subadult male polar bears along the coast of Hudson Bay during August-September 2021-2022. Fur tags were compared with ear tags deployed on 42 subadult and adult male polar bears captured on the coast or the sea ice between 2016 and 2022. We used data from the tags to quantify the amount of time subadult and adult males spent resting versus traveling while on land. Our results show the three fur tag designs remained functional for shorter mean durations (SeaTrkr = 58 days; tribrush = 47 days; pentagon = 22 days) than ear tags (121 days), but positional error estimates were comparable among the Argos-equipped tags. The GPS/Iridium-equipped SeaTrkr fur tags provided higher resolution and more frequent location data. Combined, the tags provided sufficient data to model different behavioural states. Furthermore, as hypothesized, subadult and adult male polar bears spent the majority of their time resting while on land, increasing time spent traveling as temperatures cooled. Fur tags show promise as a short-term means of collecting movement data from free-ranging polar bears.

Evolving Accumulation of a Complex Profile of Polychlorinated Alkanes in Canadian Polar Bears	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						polychlorinated alkanes; chlorinated paraffins; Arctic; Hudson Bay; polar bear; temporalchange; diet; fatty acids	CHAIN CHLORINATED PARAFFINS; CONTAMINATION; WILDLIFE; EXPOSURE; ECOLOGY; LEGACY	Approximately 33 million t of polychlorinated alkanes (PCAs), also known as chlorinated paraffins, has been globally produced and used. Despite the higher bioaccumulation potential of PCAs in terrestrial ecosystems than in marine ecosystems, North American terrestrial PCA data are sparse and Arctic studies largely focus on short-chain PCAs, with minimal attention to longer-chain homologues in wildlife. This research delves into the dynamics of PCA accumulation and temporal changes across a broad spectrum of PCA homologues in polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Hudson Bay. Subcutaneous fat samples collected over the past decade from adult male polar bears of the Western Hudson Bay (WHB) and Southern Hudson Bay (SHB) subpopulations were analyzed, identifying 109 of 545 PCA homologues, ranging from C-8 to C-26. Analysis of 37 dietary fatty acids provided insights into dietary shifts and their influence on PCA profiles. Notably, SHB bears exhibited a decrease in PCA concentrations, reflecting marine food web influences. In contrast, WHB bears displayed increasing PCA levels, likely due to the use of more terrestrial and anthropogenic food sources. This study underscores the critical yet overlooked role of longer-chain PCAs in the Arctic food web and polar bear exposure, emphasizing the variance between subpopulations and the significant impact of dietary factors.

An assessment of microplastics in fecal samples from polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in Canada's North	ARCTIC SCIENCE			English	Article						plastic pollution; mammals; plastic ingestion; Arctic	ANTHROPOGENIC PARTICLES; MARINE MAMMALS; HUDSON-BAY; IDENTIFICATION; SCIENCE; SUMMER; LITTER	We assessed the potential for plastic ingestion in polar bears (Ursus maritimus (Phipps (1774))) using fecal analysis. Two method studies ensured our protocols could effectively recover and identify plastics in feces. First, microplastics (film, foam, or fragments) were intentionally introduced into a model organic matrix. Recovery rates (mean +/- standard deviation) averaged 95.8 +/- 14.7% (n = 18) and were significantly affected by microplastic morphology but not digestion status. Second, microplastic fragments of polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene were intentionally introduced to polar bear feces. Recovery rates averaged 79.3 +/- 21.6% (n = 8) and Raman microscopy successfully identified all three polymers in 87.5% of samples. The main study then investigated the presence of microplastics in hunter-collected polar bear feces in the Canadian Arctic. Feces from the colons of hunted bears (n = 15) and field scat (n = 15) were collected through collaboration with Inuit communities. Polypropylene, polyethylene, and/or polyethylene terephthalate were detected in the feces of eight bears. Concentrations of microplastics in feces were, on average, less than 1 particle/g dry weight feces and at or near detection limits. Overall, this work suggests microplastic ingestion by Canadian polar bears may be low and demonstrates the utility of fecal sampling for community-based monitoring programs.

Development of an 8K SNP chip to assess adaptive diversity and hybridization in polar bears	CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES			English	Article						Ancestry; Illumina Infinium Beadchip; Grizzly bear; Ursus arctos; Polar bear; Ursus maritimus	BROWN BEARS; POPULATION GENOMICS; URSUS-MARITIMUS; GRIZZLY BEARS; GENE FLOW; R PACKAGE; EVOLUTIONARY; CONSERVATION; HYBRIDS; ARCTOS	The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a species particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. As the climate warms, polar bears will be forced to move to more suitable habitats which are likely to shrink, adapt to the new conditions, or decline in population size. However, the genomic diversity within and among all 19 subpopulations of polar bears, and therefore their adaptive potential, is currently unknown. In addition, warmer climates are likely to result in more frequent contact between polar bears and grizzly bears (U. arctos), with which they can hybridize. Here we describe the development, quality control, and application of the Ursus maritimus V2 SNP chip. This 8 K SNP chip contains loci explicitly selected to assess both RAD-derived and transcriptome-derived loci, as well as SNPs to detect hybridization between species. A total of 7,239 loci (90.3% of those printed) were successfully genotyped, with over 99% genotype concordance for individuals typed in duplicate on this chip, and between individuals typed here and on the Ursus maritimus V1 SNP chip. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the markers have high accuracy and efficiency to detect hybridization and backcrosses between polar bears and grizzly bears. However, empirical analysis of 371 polar bears, 440 grizzly bears, and 8 known hybrids found no novel instances of recent hybridization. The Ursus maritimus V2 SNP chip provides a powerful tool for monitoring the adaptive potential of this species along with assessing population structure, quantitative genomics, and hybridization in polar bears.

Laparoscopic Evaluation of the Reproductive Tract in Two Female Polar Bears (Three Procedures) (Ursus maritimus)	LIFE-BASEL			English	Article						polar bear; laparoscopy; ovary; ultrasound; reproduction	INSEMINATION; ECOLOGY	Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) face a number of challenges that threaten the survival of the species. Captive breeding represents one essential facet of species conservation, but aspects of the polar bear's reproductive physiology, such as follicle maturation, coitus-induced ovulation, and pseudopregnancy, are poorly characterized and present challenges for enhancing natural reproductive success and the application of advanced reproductive techniques. Due to the absence of a reliable transrectal or transabdominal ultrasound method for ovarian examination in the species, the ovaries of two adult female polar bears were examined laparoscopically to evaluate the feasibility of surgical access to the ovaries, oviduct, and uterus. The minimally invasive procedure was easily and rapidly performed in both bears and all procedures. Direct visual assessment of the ovary was possible after dissection of a fatty bursal sac, which completely enclosed the ovaries. In the second bear, laparoscopic manipulation of the ovary to draw it closer to the body wall enabled transcutaneous ultrasound. Laparoscopy may be a valuable tool to aid in the application of advanced reproductive technologies in polar bears.

Assessing the risk of climate maladaptation for Canadian polar bears	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						adaptation; gene flow; genetic offset; genetic variation; polar bear; sea ice loss; Ursus maritimus	SEA-ICE; URSUS-MARITIMUS; POPULATION-SIZE; R PACKAGE; ADAPTATION; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; EDGE; LIFE	The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, threatening the persistence of many Arctic species. It is uncertain if Arctic wildlife will have sufficient time to adapt to such rapidly warming environments. We used genetic forecasting to measure the risk of maladaptation to warming temperatures and sea ice loss in polar bears (Ursus maritimus) sampled across the Canadian Arctic. We found evidence for local adaptation to sea ice conditions and temperature. Forecasting of genome-environment mismatches for predicted climate scenarios suggested that polar bears in the Canadian high Arctic had the greatest risk of becoming maladapted to climate warming. While Canadian high Arctic bears may be the most likely to become maladapted, all polar bears face potentially negative outcomes to climate change. Given the importance of the sea ice habitat to polar bears, we expect that maladaptation to future warming is already widespread across Canada.	[Rivkin, L.

In the United States, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) protects polar bears from incidental disturbance from human activities. For the remote and roadless areas of northern Alaska, USA, effective management of small aircraft activity is necessary to limit disturbance, but effects of overflights on polar bear behavior are largely unknown. During 2021 and 2022, we intentionally exposed polar bears (n = 115) to systematic aircraft activity (helicopter, fixed-wing) until we observed a disruption of behavior that qualified as a level B take response (e.g., abrupt change in activity or movement) under the MMPA. We used a Bayesian logistic regression to determine what factors influence and can be used to predict when a polar bear will exhibit a level B take response and estimate the probability of an aircraft eliciting a level B take response at different altitudes above the polar bear. Aircraft type, flight altitude, landscape (barrier islands vs. mainland), and bear behavior (active vs. inactive) upon initial aircraft encounter were all important predictors of take. Probability of take rapidly increased with a decrease in flight altitude starting at 450 m for helicopter and 300 m for fixed-wing aircraft. Active (e.g., standing, walking) polar bears on barrier-island landscapes were more likely to experience take than inactive (e.g., bedded) bears on mainland landscapes. Our findings can help with assessments and management plans by quantifying disturbance to polar bears from current and future human activity that involves aircraft use.

We subsequently documented a 21-year-old solitary female who was lactating and in breeding condition with swollen labia, suggesting polar bears return to estrous quickly in the absence of cubs. Using the literature, we examined the relationships among polar bear cub-of-theyear, adult male survival, and the ratio of male/female mortality. We suggest SSI as the plausible explanation for the infanticide event observed and discuss how indirect effects from climate change may affect the prevalence of infanticide as a mechanism regulating polar bear populations.

Potential impacts of an autumn oil spill on polar bears summering on land in northern Alaska	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						1002 area; Alaska; Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; Oil spill; Polar bear; Simulation	SEA	Demand for oil and natural gas continues to increase, leading to the development of remote regions where it is riskier to operate. Many of these regions have had limited development, so understanding potential impacts to wildlife could inform management decisions. In 2017, the United States passed legislation allowing oil and gas development in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Alaska. This area has received limited industrial development and is an important region for polar bears that use the coastline as a travel corridor in autumn. We sought to understand how an autumn near-shore oil spill in the Refuge could affect polar bears. We simulated oil spills from shallow sub-sea pipelines at 3 locations along the coastline of the Refuge and allowed spills to discharge 4800 barrels of oil per day for 6 days, and tracked oil for 50 days. We interacted the trajectories with simulated polar bear movements to estimate how many bears might be exposed. Oil spread quickly along the coastline and during some weeks exposed an average of 10 bears (95 % CI: 0-37) to lethal levels of oil, and 60 (95 % CI: 9-120) to sub-lethal levels. Our results suggest a significant number of polar bears could become oiled from a spill in the region and require decontamination. Therefore, future mitigation strategies could include careful siting of future development and additional capacity to capture and decontaminate bears in the event of an oil spill.

The fecal microbiome of habitat-housed captive polar bears who had consumed a high protein diet long-term was compared with that of the wild population. Individual differences, season, year and dietary inclusion of a brown seaweed (Fucus spiralis; part of the natural diet of wild polar bears), as a representation for nutritional change, were investigated for their effects on the fecal microbiome of captive polar bears. Microbial variations among fecal samples from wild and captive polar bears were investigated using 16s rRNA gene based metataxonomic profiling. The captive bears exhibited more diverse fecal microbiota than wild bears (p<0.05). The difference was due to significantly increased Firmicutes, Campilobacterota and Fusobacteriota, decreased Actinobacteriota (p<0.05), and absent Bdellovibrionota and Verrucomicrobiota in the captive bears. Compared with other factors, individual variation was the main driver of differences in fecal microbial composition in the captive bears. Seaweed consumption did not alter microbial diversity or composition, but this did not rule out dietary influences on the hosts. This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, comparing the fecal microbiota of captive and wild polar bears and it reveals distinct differences between the two groups, which could result from many factors, including available food sources and the ratio of dietary macronutrients. Our findings provide preliminary insights into climate-change induced dietary shifts in polar bears related to climate-associated habitat change.

Current management practices include pairing mates at five to six years of age, but there is evidence that wild bears have sired cubs as early as two years old. Timing acquisition of sexual maturity in male polar bears could aid in determining when mates should be paired in ex situ populations. To address this, non-invasive fecal testosterone metabolite monitoring was evaluated as a technique for establishing age of sexual maturity in 14 male polar bears (aged 1-6.9 years) for 1-6 years. Testosterone metabolite concentrations were monitored throughout the year and evaluated by breeding season (Jan. 1-May 21) compared to non-breeding season (May 22-Dec. 31). Sexual maturity was defined as when testosterone metabolite concentrations were significantly greater during breeding season than non-breeding season and bi-weekly averages were elevated above baseline for a minimum of ten weeks during breeding season mimicking patterns in adult male polar bears. Testosterone metabolite concentrations ranged from 5.9 to 8342 ng/g. One bear met the defined criteria at two years of age and an additional three bears met criteria at three years old. Due to the sampling strategy and the requirements set forth by the definition of sexual maturity, there were confounding results. In two cases, bears determined to be sexually mature the year prior, were not categorized as mature the next year. Another bear demonstrated greater testosterone metabolite values during the non-breeding season than breeding season. This study demonstrated the variability in fecal testosterone metabolites in juvenile polar bears and results suggest that hormone assessment alone is not adequate for determining sexual maturity in ex situ male polar bears. However, if used in tandem with behavioral monitoring and semen collection, when possible, could aid breeding management decisions for ex situ populations.

Long-term assessment of relationships between changing environmental conditions and the physiology of southern Beaufort Sea polar bears (Ursus maritimus)	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						Arctic oscillation; biomarker; climate change; clinical pathology; physiologic plasticity; physiology; polar bear; population health; Ursus maritimus; wildlife	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SERUM CREATININE; MARINE MAMMALS; PUSA-HISPIDA; ICE; ECOLOGY; TEMPERATURE; PARAMETERS; INDICATORS; HABITAT	Climate change is influencing polar bear (Ursus maritimus) habitat, diet, and behavior but the effects of these changes on their physiology is not well understood. Blood-based biomarkers are used to assess the physiologic health of individuals but their usefulness for evaluating population health, especially as it relates to changing environmental conditions, has rarely been explored. We describe links between environmental conditions and physiologic functions of southern Beaufort Sea polar bears using data from blood samples collected from 1984 to 2018, a period marked by extensive environmental change. We evaluated associations between 13 physiologic biomarkers and circumpolar (Arctic oscillation index) and regional (wind patterns and ice-free days) environmental metrics and seasonal and demographic co-variates (age, sex, season, and year) known to affect polar bear ecology. We observed signs of dysregulation of water balance in polar bears following years with a lower annual Arctic oscillation index. In addition, liver enzyme values increased over time, which is suggestive of potential hepatocyte damage as the Arctic has warmed. Biomarkers of immune function increased with regional-scale wind patterns and the number of ice-free days over the Beaufort Sea continental shelf and were lower in years with a lower winter Arctic oscillation index, suggesting an increased allocation of energetic resources for immune processes under these conditions. We propose that the variation in polar bear immune and metabolic function is likely indicative of physiologic plasticity, a response that allows polar bears to remain in homeostasis even as they experience changes in nutrition and habitat in response to changing environments.

As a result, mastering the mechanisms responsible for arctic animals' superior radiative insulation will be aided by knowing the radiative exchanges in their fur. A mathematical model was created for this purpose by integrating the coat's hairs into thin sheets. Then, using MATLAB, a computer simulation was run to determine the temperature variation as well as the energy flow between the external environment and the polar animal's body through the hairs. With such thermal qualities, the proposed model will have a good insulating capacity, allowing it to recreate the structure of polar bear hair and incorporate it into real-world applications, such as serving as just a thermal insulator for keeping the heat in a house during the winter.

User plastics and rubbish other than plastics were observed in 28.6% (12/42) and 11.9% (5/42), respectively. Acute gastritiswas present in 33.3% (14/42) of polar bear stomachs. Fifty percent of the acute gastritis cases (n = 7) were observed in animals with user plastics in their stomach content. The findings of our multiyear polar bear stomach-content analysis emphasize that anthropogenic waste ingestion is common in polar bears of the Southern Beaufort Sea subpopulation. For the future, controlling access to anthropogenic foods (e.g., garbage dumps, stored wildlife resources) will be an important component of proactive human polar bear management on the North Slope, Alaska, and for the entire Arctic.

Serum Virome of Southern Beaufort Sea polar bears (Ursus maritimus) during a period of rapid climate change	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Anellovirus; climate change; Polar bear; virus; wildlife health	INFECTIOUS AGENTS; CORTISOL-LEVELS; MARINE MAMMALS; HAIR CORTISOL; VIRUS; ANELLOVIRUSES; RANGE; IDENTIFICATION; PREVALENCE; ANTIBODIES	We characterized the serum virome of polar bears from Alaska#x2019;s Beaufort Sea. We identified 48 anelloviruses, which in humans are linked to immunosuppression. Polar bear anelloviruses did not vary with physiological, behavioral or demographic factors, but do appear to change with time. These data provide a baseline for assessing future changes. Climate change affects the behavior, physiology and life history of many Arctic wildlife species. It can also influence the distribution and ecology of infectious agents. The southern Beaufort Sea (SB) subpopulation of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) has experienced dramatic behavioral changes due to retreating sea ice and other climate-related factors, but the effects of these changes on physiology and infection remain poorly understood. Using serum from polar bears sampled between 2004 and 2015 and metagenomic DNA sequencing, we identified 48 viruses, all of the family Anelloviridae. Anelloviruses are small, ubiquitous infectious agents with circular single-stranded DNA genomes that are not known to cause disease but, in humans, covary in diversity and load with immunological compromise. We therefore examined the usefulness of anelloviruses as biomarkers of polar bear physiological stress related to climate and habitat use. Polar bear anelloviruses sorted into two distinct clades on a phylogenetic tree, both of which also contained anelloviruses of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), another ursid. Neither anellovirus diversity nor load were associated with any demographic variables, behavioral factors or direct physiological measures. However, pairwise genetic distances between anelloviruses were positively correlated with pairwise differences in sampling date, suggesting that the polar bear "anellome" is evolving over time. These findings suggest that anelloviruses are not a sensitive indicator of polar physiological stress, but they do provide a baseline for evaluating future changes to polar bear viromes.

A colonial-nesting seabird shows limited heart rate responses to natural variation in threats of polar bears	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE			English	Article						common eider; polar bear; heart rate response; Arctic colonial nesting seabird; predation threat; dynamic risk assessment	STRESS RESPONSIVENESS; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; URSUS-MARITIMUS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; BODY CONDITION; COMMON EIDERS; PREDATION; SEA; DISTANCE; BEHAVIOR	Several predator-prey systems are in flux as an indirect result of climate change. In the Arctic, earlier sea-ice loss is driving polar bears (Ursus maritimus) onto land when many colonial nesting seabirds are breeding. The result is a higher threat of nest predation for birds with potential limited ability to respond. We quantified heart rate change in a large common eider (Somateria mollissima) breeding colony in the Canadian Arctic to explore their adaptive capacity to keep pace with the increasing risk of egg predation by polar bears. Eiders displayed on average higher heart rates from baseline when polar bears were within their field of view. Moreover, eiders were insensitive to variation in the distance bears were to their nests, but exhibited mild bradycardia (lowered heart rate) the longer the eider was exposed to the bear given the hen's visibility. Results indicate that a limited ability to assess the risks posed by polar bears may result in long-term fitness consequences for eiders from the increasing frequency in interactions with this predator.

Incremental evolution of modeling a prognosis for polar bears in a rapidly changing Arctic	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Model evolution; Polar bear; Climate change; Arctic sea ice; Bayesian network	SEA-ICE; GLACIERS; IMPACTS	Updating predictions of the response of high-profile, at-risk species to climate change and anthropogenic stressors is vital for informing effective conservation action. Here, we review two prior generations of Bayesian network probability models predicting changes in global polar bear (Ursus maritimus) population status, and provide a contemporary update based on recent research findings and sea-ice projections by newer climate models. We compare predictions of polar bear population response from all 3 models among four circumpolar Arctic ecoregions, using sea ice projections based on three IPCC greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (SSP2.6, 4.5, 8.5). Consistent with the previous two model generations, polar bears will continue to experience increasing probability of declining or greatly declining populations throughout the 21st century, varying by emission scenario. Populations within the Polar Basin Divergent Ice Ecoregion have the highest predicted probability of declines, but predictions were slightly less dire relative to the previous model generation. Most of the influence, denoted by model sensitivity analysis, is from expected degradation and loss of sea ice and reduced access to marine prey. The lack of terrestrial prey adequate to substitute for loss of access to marine prey, as well as human-caused bear morality associated with hunting and defense of life and property encountered when polar bears are increasingly forced ashore also contributed to predicted declines. Although some tidewater glacial fjords and other localized onshore resources may provide local refugia, their benefit is transient. Our findings continue to inform priorities for inventory, monitoring, and research needs, and suggest that similar updates to models of other at-risk species can capitalize on the comparison framework we present here.

Previous research has used Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) technology to detect bear dens but has only achieved a detection accuracy of 45% for single flights. The thermal nature of FLIR means that some bears are never detected nor are detectable using FLIR. In this paper we explore the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as an alternative polar bear detection technology in a simple pilot study in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, during October 2021. In this experimental study, we focused on the detection of polar bears on the surface in the SAR images. The result of this study can inform future efforts to proceed to den-detection experiments. In this study, we achieved a polar bear identification accuracy of 66%, albeit with a small sample size. Many of the challenges we encountered involved low signal-to-noise ratios and imprecise flight paths. Concurrent research from other parties shows that neural networks and other machine learning techniques can overcome these challenges to some degree, suggesting that SAR may be a promising candidate to become an effective tool for polar bear detection, particularly when coupled with other sensors such as FLIR.

Each bear was dissected. Ectoparasites were searched for in their ears and fur, helminths in the gastrointestinal tract and Trichinella larvae in muscles. Protozoan cysts, oocysts and helminth eggs were also searched for in faecal samples. No ectoparasites were detected. Two bears (40%) hosted fourth stage larvae of the nematode Contracaecum osculatum (strain B) in the stomach. Characteristic scars, noted as craters in the rectum wall, indicated previous acanthocephalan infection in one bear. Three polar bears were infected by the nematode Trichinella nativa. No protozoan parasites were detected in faecal samples, but cysts of the heterokontophyte Blastocystis sp. were found in faeces of two bears (40%). This is the first report of C. osculatum, Blastocystis sp. and an acanthocephalan infection in free-living polar bears.

This admixture event cannot be detected using genomic data from living polar bears. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) and brown bears (Ursus arctos) are sister species possessing distinct physiological and behavioural adaptations that evolved over the last 500,000 years. However, comparative and population genomics analyses have revealed that several extant and extinct brown bear populations have relatively recent polar bear ancestry, probably as the result of geographically localized instances of gene flow from polar bears into brown bears. Here, we generate and analyse an approximate 20X paleogenome from an approximately 100,000-year-old polar bear that reveals a massive prehistoric admixture event, which is evident in the genomes of all living brown bears. This ancient admixture event was not visible from genomic data derived from living polar bears. Like more recent events, this massive admixture event mainly involved unidirectional gene flow from polar bears into brown bears and occurred as climate changes caused overlap in the ranges of the two species. These findings highlight the complex reticulate paths that evolution can take within a regime of radically shifting climate.

ST data provide biological information relevant to subpopulation delineation, movements, habitat use, maternal denning, health, human-bear interactions, and accurate estimates of vital rates and abundance. Given that polar bears are distributed at low densities over vast and remote habitats, much of the information provided by ST data cannot be collected by other means. Obtaining ST data for polar bears requires chemical immobilization and application of a tracking device. Although immobilization has not been found to have negative effects beyond a several-day reduction in activity, over the last few decades opposition to immobilization and deployment of satellite-linked radio collars has resulted in a lack of current ST data in many of the 19 recognized polar bear subpopulations. Here, we review the uses of ST data for polar bears and evaluate its role in addressing 21(st) century conservation and management challenges, which include estimation of sustainable harvest rates, understanding the impacts of climate warming, delineating critical habitat, and assessing potential anthropogenic impacts from tourism, resource development and extraction. We found that in subpopulations where ST data have been consistently collected, information was available to estimate vital rates and subpopulation density, document the effects of sea-ice loss, and inform management related to subsistence harvest and regulatory requirements. In contrast, a lack of ST data in some subpopulations resulted in increased bias and uncertainty in ecological and demographic parameters, which has a range of negative consequences. As sea-ice loss due to climate warming continues, there is a greater need to monitor polar bear distribution, habitat use, abundance, and subpopulation connectivity. We conclude that continued collection of ST data will be critically important for polar bear management and conservation in the 21(st) century and that the benefits of immobilizing small numbers of individual polar bears in order to deploy ST devices significantly outweigh the risks.					aars, jon/AAB-3076-2021; Routti, Heli/AAM-7884-2020	Aars, Jon/0000-0002-0574-6712; 	NASA [80NSSC18K1229]	NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))	Funding Authors were supported by their individual agencies.

Observed and forecasted changes in land use by polar bears in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, 1985-2040	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Arctic; Global warming; Human-wildlife conflict; Sea ice; Ursus maritimus	INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT SCENARIOMIP; OPEN-WATER PERIOD; URSUS-MARITIMUS; LONG-TERM; APEX PREDATOR; BODY CONDITION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHOCA-HISPIDA; RINGED SEALS; ICE	Monitoring changes in the distribution of large carnivores is important for managing human safety and supporting conservation. Throughout much of their range, polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are increasingly using terrestrial habitats in response to Arctic sea ice decline. Their increased presence in coastal areas has implications for bear-human conflict, inter-species interactions, and polar bear health and survival. We examined observed trends in land use over three decades by polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea (SB) and Chukchi Sea (CS) where bears have traditionally spent most of the year on the sea ice. Using data from 408 adult females fitted with satellite radio-collars, we examined trends in the annual proportion of bears coming onshore (hereafter referred to as "percent of bears") during the summer for >= 21 days, arrival and departure dates, duration spent onshore and relationships with sea ice metrics. We then estimated future land use through 2040 by extrapolating trends and by combining observed relationships between land use and sea ice with projections of future sea ice from an ensemble of earth system models. The observed percent of bears summering onshore and their duration onshore was correlated with the percent of open water that occurred within their population's range between July and October. As sea ice declined, the percent of bears summering onshore increased from similar to 5-30% in the SB and similar to 10-50% in the CS and duration onshore increased by > 30 days to 60-70 days in both populations. Using a range of greenhouse gas emission scenarios and adjustments for faster than forecasted sea ice loss we estimated that 50-62% of SB and 79-88% of CS bears will spend 90-108 and 110-126 days onshore during summer in the SB and CS, respectively, by 2040. Sea ice projections varied little between greenhouse gas emission scenarios prior to 2040 but diverged thereafter. Observed and forecasted increases in polar bear land occupancy puts more bears in proximity to human activities and settlements for longer durations while extending the lack of access to their primary prey. Because human conflict is one of the primary factors affecting the conservation of large carnivores worldwide, mitigation of bear-human interactions on land will be an increasingly important component of polar bear conservation.

Anthropogenic food: an emerging threat to polar bears	ORYX			English	Article						Anthropogenic food; Arctic; human-bear conflict; polar bear; Ursus maritimus	WESTERN HUDSON-BAY; SOUTHERN BEAUFORT SEA; URSUS-MARITIMUS; APEX PREDATOR; BLACK BEARS; SERUM UREA; WILDLIFE; ICE; CONFLICT; BEHAVIOR	Supplemental food from anthropogenic sources is a source of conflict with humans for many wildlife species. Food-seeking behaviours by black bears Ursus americanus and brown bears Ursus arctos can lead to property damage, human injury and mortality of the offending bears. Such conflicts are a well-known conservation management issue wherever people live in bear habitats. In contrast, the use of anthropogenic foods by the polar bear Ursus maritimus is less common historically but is a growing conservation and management issue across the Arctic. Here we present six case studies that illustrate how negative food-related interactions between humans and polar bears can become either chronic or ephemeral and unpredictable. Our examination suggests that attractants are an increasing problem, exacerbated by climate change-driven sea-ice losses that cause increased use of terrestrial habitats by bears. Growing human populations and increased human visitation increase the likelihood of human-polar bear conflict. Efforts to reduce food conditioning in polar bears include attractant management, proactive planning and adequate resources for northern communities to reduce conflicts and improve human safety. Permanent removal of unsecured sources of nutrition, to reduce food conditioning, should begin immediately at the local level as this will help to reduce polar bear mortality.

Classifying the effects of human disturbance on denning polar bears	ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH			English	Article						Denning; Human disturbance; Industrial development; Polar bear; Reproduction; Ursus maritimus	SOUTHERN BEAUFORT SEA; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; URSUS-MARITIMUS; BROWN BEARS; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; BLACK BEARS; BODY-MASS; HABITAT; ICE; RATES	Climate change is resulting in decreased sea ice extent and increased industrial activity in Arctic regions. In northern Alaska, USA, sea ice loss has increased the frequency of land-based polar bear Ursus maritimus maternal dens, leading to greater potential for overlap between industrial activities and denning bears. Responses of denning bears to human disturbance could result in costly reproductive outcomes, although observation of these responses is logistically challenging and expensive. We developed a method to standardize the process of classifying the response of denning polar bears to disturbance using decision rules based on polar bear biology and denning chronology. We applied this method to 46 maternal polar bear dens exposed to human activity (e.g. vehicle traffic, ground-based monitoring). Because the timing of disturbance influences the response and subsequent fitness consequences, we determined outcomes specific to 4 denning periods: (1) den establishment (excavation to cub birth); (2) early denning (cub birth to 60 d old); (3) late denning (60 d old to emergence); and (4) post-emergence (emergence to den site departure). We classified the outcomes of 79 exposures as 37 having 'no documented effect' (no observed response), 7 as 'behavioral' (observed behavioral disruption), 17 as 'early emergence' (den emergence occurring earlier than an undisturbed emergence), 14 as 'early departure' (den site abandonment post-emergence earlier than if undisturbed), and 4 as 'cub mortality' (death or abandonment of >= 1 cub). Outcomes with potential fitness consequences occurred in every denning period. Our classification method facilitated a standardized approach that can be used to classify the outcome of den disturbance. Determining outcomes in relation to a specific denning period may facilitate improved implementation of mitigation strategies to reduce disturbance to denning bears.

The Adrenal Cortisol Response to Increasing Ambient Temperature in Polar Bears (Ursus maritimus)	ANIMALS			English	Article						thermoregulation; climate change; glucocorticoid; HPA axis; conservation	BODY-TEMPERATURE; APEX PREDATOR; SEA-ICE; METABOLISM; STRESS; ENERGY; REPRODUCTION; VALIDATION; BEHAVIOR; IMPACTS	Simple Summary Human-caused climate change is proceeding rapidly and providing challenges to wildlife species, especially those adapted to colder temperatures. We investigated the cortisol response of polar bears to increasing ambient temperatures to improve our knowledge of the physiology of this Arctic species with the goal of informing management in zoos and in the wild. In adult polar bears temperatures above 20 degrees C were associated with an increase in the hormone cortisol to accommodate increased thermoregulatory demands. This temperature threshold was surprisingly high for an Arctic-adapted species. Zoos can provide sufficient housing options to prevent overheating in polar bears exposed to warmer temperatures but our results are concerning for wild polar bears. The number of days reaching 20 degrees C in the Arctic has increased significantly over the past 30 years and the associated increase in thermoregulatory costs add to the physiological burden many wild polar bears are already facing with the loss of sea ice hunting opportunities. We recommend that the management of polar bears in the wild and under human care be adapted to reflect the increased cortisol concentrations associated with thermoregulatory challenges in warmer temperatures. Our objective was to identify the upper ambient temperature threshold that triggers an increase in cortisol in response to increased thermoregulatory demands in polar bears. The results reported here include endocrine data collected over two years from 25 polar bears housed in 11 accredited zoological institutions across North America. The effects of ambient temperature, sex, age group (juvenile, adult, elderly), breeding season and humidity on fecal cortisol metabolite (FCM) concentrations (N = 8439 samples) were evaluated using linear mixed models. Ambient temperatures were placed into five different categories: <5 degrees C, 6-10 degrees C, 11-15 degrees C, 16-20 degrees C, and >20 degrees C. Ambient temperature and humidity had a significant (p < 0.05) effect on FCM concentrations with significant (p < 0.05) interactions of sex, age and breeding season. Once biotic factors were accounted for, there was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in FCM concentrations associated with ambient temperatures above 20 degrees C in adult polar bears. The implications of these findings for the management of both zoo and wild polar bears are discussed.
