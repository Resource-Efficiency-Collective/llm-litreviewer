Cow-calf contact, or lack thereof, is expected to affect emotional states, but this requires empirical testing. Different types of cow-calf contact may also affect the emotional states of cows. The primary objective of this study was to assess the emotional state of dairy cows with full-time (23 h/d), part-time (10 h/d), or no-contact with their calves (separated 48 h after birth), using a visual judgment bias test (JBT) about one month after calving; JBT is the current gold-standard method to assess emotional state in animals by evaluating optimism or pessimism (illustrated by the proverbial half-full or half-empty water glass). The secondary objective was to compare outcomes of color- versus shape-based visual JBT. Fifty dairy cows were trained to approach a positive image on a screen (rewarded with food) and to avoid a negative image (else punished with waving bag). Once learned (>80% correct over 2 consecutive days), cows were presented with 3 ambiguous images (each presented once per day among 4 positive and 3 negative images, repeated over 4 d), and their approach responses recorded. For the color method (10 full-time, 9 part-time and 11 no-contact cows), positive and negative images were a solid red or white background; ambiguous images were shades of pink. For the shape method (8 full-time, 6 part-time and 6 no-contact cows), positive and negative images were a white circle or cross on a black background; ambiguous images were overlaid circle and cross in varying shades of gray. Cows learned to discriminate colors quicker than shapes (7.3 d, confidence limits [CL]: 6.6-8.2 d; vs. 9.3 d, CL: 8.1-10.6 d). Approaches to ambiguous colors followed a generalization curve (81.0, 33.1, and 5.0 +/- 3.7% for near-positive, middle, and near-negative images, respectively), but not approaches to ambiguous shapes (31.9%, 25.7%, and 21.9% +/- 4.8%, respectively), indicating colors over shapes should be used in visual JBT for cattle. Part-time cows approached fewer ambiguous color images than full-time cows (23.5%, CL: 13.4%-34.4%; vs. 44.8%, CL; 32.8%-57.1%) whereas no-contact cows were intermediate, but not different from full-time or part-time cows (37.8%, CL; 26.8%-49.5%). The color JBT results show a pessimistic bias (indicating a negative emotional state) in cows with part-time calf contact, possibly due to repeated daily separation from her young calf, relative to cows with full-time calf contact. Thus, cow-calf contact systems appear to influence the emotional state of cows depending on the practice. Cows without calf contact showed no difference in judgment bias between cows with full- or part-time calf contact, suggesting these cows probably do not experience a pervasive negative emotional state (relative to those with calf contact) approximately 30 d after calf separation. However, individual variability in judgment bias was evident for all treatments. The visual judgment bias test is a useful methodology for assessing emotional states of dairy cows; future research should prioritize understanding the emotional states of dairy cows in alternative management systems.","[Neave, Heather W.; Jensen, Emma Hvidtfeldt; Jensen, Margit Bak] Aarhus Univ, Dept Anim & Vet Sci, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark; [Rault, Jean-Loup] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Inst Anim Welf Sci, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Bateson, Melissa] Newcastle Univ, Biosci Inst, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, England",Aarhus University; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; Newcastle University - UK,"Neave, HW (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Anim & Vet Sci, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark.",heather.neave@anivet.au.dk,"; Bateson, Melissa/B-1874-2008; Neave, Heather/LQK-1489-2024","Rault, Jean-Loup/0000-0001-6015-8318; Bateson, Melissa/0000-0002-0861-0191; Jensen, Margit Bak/0000-0001-7982-582X; Jensen, Emma Hvidtfeldt/0000-0002-1478-2870","Independent Research Fund Denmark (Odense, Denmark)","Independent Research Fund Denmark (Odense, Denmark)(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF))","We gratefully thank the barn staff at the Danish Cattle Research Centre, Aarhus University (Viborg, Denmark) for the management and care of all cows, and to all the students for their assistance with cow training and testing: Marine Durrenwachter (Ecole Superieure d'Agro-Developement International, Angers, France) , Vanessa De Jesus and Clara Osmont (AgroSup Dijon, Dijon, France) , Martin Clipet (Institut Polytechnique UniLaSalle, Beauvais, France) , Ze Yin (Aarhus University, Denmark) , Katrine Haugaard and Sophie Dalsgaard (Business Academy Aarhus, School of Applied Sciences, Aarhus, Denmark) , and Ludye-Ann Jossen (AgroSup Dijon) .

However, it is unclear whether nutritional diarrhea develops as a result of gut acidosis and/or dysbiosis. This study aimed to uncover changes in the gastrointestinal microbiota and its fermentation parameters in response to nutritional diarrhea in postpartum dairy cows. Rumen and fecal samples were collected from twenty-four postpartum cows fed with the same diet but with different fecal scores: the low-fecal-score (LFS: diarrheic) group and high-fecal-score (HFS: non-diarrheic) group. A microbiota difference was only observed for fecal microbiota, with the relative abundance of Defluviitaleaceae_UCG-011 and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-001 tending (p < 0.10) to be higher in HFS cows compared to LFS cows, and Frisingicoccus were only detected in HFS cows. The fecal bacterial community in LFS cows had higher robustness (p < 0.05) compared to that in HFS cows, and also had lower negative cohesion (less competitive behaviors) and higher positive cohesion (more cooperative behaviors) (p < 0.05) compared that in to HFS cows. Lower total volatile fatty acids and higher ammonia nitrogen (p < 0.05) were observed in LFS cows' feces compared to HFS cows. The observed shift in fecal bacterial composition, community networks, and metabolites suggests that hindgut dysbiosis could be related to nutritional diarrhea in postpartum cows.","[Hao, Yangyi; Ouyang, Tong; Wang, Wei; Wang, Yajing; Cao, Zhijun; Yang, Hongjian; Li, Shengli] China Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Anim Nutr, Beijing Engn Technol Res Ctr Raw Milk Qual & Safet, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yangyi; Guan, Le Luo] Univ Alberta, Dept Agr Food & Nutr Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2P5, Canada",China Agricultural University; University of Alberta,"Li, SL (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Anim Nutr, Beijing Engn Technol Res Ctr Raw Milk Qual & Safet, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Guan, LL (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Agr Food & Nutr Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2P5, Canada.",haoyangyi0928@163.com; caozhijun@cau.edu.cn; yang_hongjian@cau.edu.cn; lguan@ualberta.ca; lisheng0677@163.com,"Yang, H.J./A-6816-2010","Cao, Zhijun/0000-0002-5519-9462; Ouyang, Tong/0000-0001-6756-6808; yangyi, Hao/0000-0002-7160-3103",National Natural Science Foundation of China; Hefei Modern Farm Company,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hefei Modern Farm Company,The authors also thank the Hefei Modern Farm Company for providing the experimental animals.,,46,10,10,8,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-2607,,MICROORGANISMS,Microorganisms,JAN,2024,12.0,1.0,,,,,,,23.0,10.3390/microorganisms12010023,0,,,14,Microbiology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Microbiology,GL5P9,38257850.0,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-15,WOS:001152840300001,0,cows

To allow some cow -calf contact, part-time contact during the first weeks is thought to be a feasible solution, but it is unknown if it weakens maternal bond, i.e., if maternal motivation is lower. This study aimed to investigate how different amounts of calf contact (full-time, part-time, and no contact) affect cows' maternal motivation. Using pneumatic push gates, we assessed cows' motivation to access their own calf using the maximum price paid (MPP) method. To mitigate frustration at high prices, cows could also access an unfamiliar calf at a constant low price. We expected that cows would access the unfamiliar calf when reaching the maximum price that they were motivated to pay to access their own calf. Following 48 h in a calving pen, cow -calf pairs were allocated to three different treatments: full-time (23 h contact/d, 28 pairs), part-time (10 h contact/d, 27 pairs), and no contact (0 h contact/d, 26 pairs). Approximately 40 d after calving, cows were trained to pass through each of two push gates: one leading to their own and one leading to an unfamiliar calf. The weight on the gate leading to the cows' own calf increased following each passing, while the gate leading to the unfamiliar calf remained light. Cows were tested once daily, until they failed to pass through the gate leading to their own calf on two consecutive days. MPP was analysed using a Cox's proportional hazards mixed effects model. Fewer nocontact cows than full- and part-time cows fulfilled the learning criteria. Furthermore, no -contact cows paid a lower maximum price compared to the two contact treatments, while the MPP of full- and part-time cows did not differ. Most cows remained in the start box if they did not pass the gate to their own calf, indicating that an unfamiliar calf could not substitute for their own calf at high prices. We conclude that cows with part-time calf contact form a maternal bond of similar strength to cows with full-time calf contact. Additionally, cows separated from their calf at 48 h after calving have a weaker maternal motivation at 40 days postpartum.","[Jensen, Emma Hvidtfeldt; Neave, Heather W.; Jensen, Margit Bak] Aarhus Univ, Dept Anim & Vet Sci, Tjele, Denmark; [Bateson, Melissa] Newcastle Univ, Biosci Inst, Newcastle Upon Tyne, England; [Rault, Jean-Loup] Univ Vet Med Vienna, Inst Anim Welf Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Neave, Heather W.] Purdue Univ, Dept Anim Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Aarhus University; Newcastle University - UK; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Jensen, EH (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Anim & Vet Sci, Tjele, Denmark.",emma.hvidtfeldt@anivet.au.dk,"Neave, Heather/LQK-1489-2024; Bateson, Melissa/B-1874-2008","Rault, Jean-Loup/0000-0001-6015-8318; Jensen, Emma Hvidtfeldt/0000-0002-1478-2870; Jensen, Margit Bak/0000-0001-7982-582X; Bateson, Melissa/0000-0002-0861-0191","Independent Research Fund Denmark (Odense, Denmark) [0136-00253B]","Independent Research Fund Denmark (Odense, Denmark)(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF))","This study is part of a larger research project investigating potential welfare benefits gained by cows housed with their calves (Can dairy cows have the best of both worlds?; 2020-2024) and is funded by the Independent Research Fund Denmark (Odense, Denmark, grant ID: 0136-00253B) .

Increasing cow-calf contact poses challenges by reducing the machine milk yield and increasing separation stress. Part-time cow-calf contact may prove more feasible than full-time contact for farmers but may affect the maternal behavior of the cows. Gradually reducing the daily contact could gradually wean the calf off milk, preparing it for separation. This study aims to investigate (1) how cows' maternal behaviors toward their own calf are affected by part-time contact, and (2) whether calves' suckling behavior is reduced by reducing daily cow contact. Fifty-six dairy cows and their calves were assigned to either full-time (23 h/d) or part-time (10 h/d) cow-calf contact for 7 wk (main rearing period). This was followed by 2 wk of either reduced contact (50% in wk 8, then 25% of original contact time in wk 9) or unchanged contact. First, the maternal behavior of full- and part-time cows was observed for 24 h in the third week of the main rearing period. Part-time cows spent less time nursing and grooming their own calf than full-time cows did. However, the amount of nursing in the inverse parallel position and the probability of a cow nursing a calf other than her own did not differ between the 2 treatments. Second, calf suckling behavior was observed for 24 h in both weeks of the reduced contact period. Averaged across both observations, total suckling time (i.e., time spent suckling any cow) was lower in parttime calves that experienced reduced contact compared with part-time calves with unchanged contact. In wk 9, time spent suckling only the dam was lower for full-time calves with reduced contact compared with part-time calves with unchanged contact. In conclusion, although we found a lower nursing and grooming time in part-time cows compared with full-time, we found no difference between treatments with regard to nursing in the inverse parallel position and nursing a calf other than the cow's own. The effect of gradually reducing cow-calf contact on calves' suckling time requires more research.","[Jensen, Emma Hvidtfeldt; Neave, Heather W.; Bateson, Melissa] Aarhus Univ, Dept Anim & Vet Sci, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark; [Bateson, Melissa; Jensen, Margit Bak] Newcastle Univ, Biosci Inst, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, England; [Neave, Heather W.] Purdue Univ, Dept Anim Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Aarhus University; Newcastle University - UK; Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Jensen, EH (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Anim & Vet Sci, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark.",emma.hvidtfeldt@anivet.au.dk,"Bateson, Melissa/B-1874-2008; Neave, Heather/LQK-1489-2024","Bateson, Melissa/0000-0002-0861-0191; Jensen, Emma Hvidtfeldt/0000-0002-1478-2870; Jensen, Margit Bak/0000-0001-7982-582X","Independent Research Fund Denmark (Odense, Denmark); Gradual School of Technical Sciences, Aarhus University (Aarhus, Denmark); Larger research project investigating the potential welfare benefits gained by dairy cows in cow-calf contact conditions (Can dairy cows have the best of both worlds?

This algorithm leverages the strengths of different data modalities, complementing each other, and enhances the performance of the cow behavior classification model. The algorithm integrates motion sensor and video data, collected by custom-made collars with inertial measurement units (IMUs) sensors placed at the top of the cow's neck and cameras in the barn, using EfficientNet V2 S, BiLSTM, and Transformer networks. Experimental results demonstrate recognition accuracies of 98.80 %, precision of 97.15 %, and recall rates of 96.93 %, showing significant improvements over single-modal data behavior recognition algorithms.

A total of 130 multi-and primiparous Holstein cows were screened for enteric CH4 emissions using the GreenFeed system (C-Lock Inc.). Out of these 130 cows, 5 were identified as phenotypically high (HM) and 5 as phenotypically low (LM) CH4 emitters. Cows in the LM group had lower daily enteric CH4 emissions than cows in the HM group (on average 346 vs. 439 g/d, respectively), lower CH4 yield (15.5 vs. 20.4 g of CH4/kg of DMI), and CH4 intensity (13.2 vs. 17.0 g of CH4/ kg of energy-corrected milk yield). Enteric emissions of CO2 and H2 did not differ between HM and LM cows. These 10 cows were blocked by parity, days in milk, and milk production, and were used in a 5-wk randomized complete block design experiment. Milk composition, production, and BW were also not different between LM and HM cows. The concentration of total volatile fatty acids in ruminal contents did not differ between CH4 phenotypes, but LM cows had a lower molar proportion of acetate (57 vs. 62.1%), a higher proportion of propionate (27.5 vs. 21.6%, respectively), and therefore a lower acetate-to-propionate ratio than HM cows. Consistently, the 16S cDNA analysis revealed the abundance of Succinivibrionaceae and unclassified Veillonellaceae to be higher in LM cows compared with HM cows, bacteria that were positively correlated with ruminal propionate concentration. Notably, Succinivibrionaceae trigger the formation of propionate via oxaloacetate pathway from phosphoenolpyruvate via Enzyme Commission: 4.1.1.49, which showed a trend to be higher in LM cows compared with HM cows. Additionally, LM cows possessed fewer transcripts of a gene encoding for methyl-CoM reductase enzyme compared with HM. In this study, low and high CH4-yield cows have similar production performance and milk composition, but total-tract apparent digestibility of organic matter and fiber fractions was lower in the former group of animals.","[Stepanchenko, N.; Stefenoni, H.; Hennessy, M.; Nagaraju, I.; Wasson, D.

Danish Holstein dairy cows were assigned to 1 of 3 cow-calf contact treatments: full-time with the calf (n = 24), part-time with the calf between morning (a.m.) and afternoon (p.m.) milking and separated overnight (n = 23), or separated from the calf at birth (n = 23). Behavior of cows (stepping and kicking in the parlor) and milking procedures (teat or udder stimulation frequency, preparation duration) were recorded at a.m. and p.m. milking on 2 d during wk 4 and 6 of the treatment period (8 milkings per cow). Full-time cows had the lowest machine milk yields (mean f SE; 6.1 and 6.0 f 0.7 L at a.m. and p.m. milking, respectively), whereas part-time cows had similar yield to no-contact cows at a.m. milking (19.6 f 0.7 L) and similar yield to full-time cows at p.m. milking (6.4 f 0.7 L). Lower machine milk yields in cows with calf contact could not be fully attributed to milk consumption by the calf; however, they also could not be explained by differences in cow parity, calf sex, milking procedures (stimulation frequency; preparation duration), or stepping and kicking (restless) behavior at milking. All cows showed more restless behavior at p.m. milking, which weakly negatively affected machine milk yield, but this was unrelated to stimulation frequency in cow-calf contact cows, indicating that there may be other sources of discomfort or stress at the time of milking for these cows. Part-time versus full-time calf contact improved daily machine milk yields, but low machine milk yield issues merit further research so that cow-calf contact systems can be sustainable for producers.","[Neave, Heather W.; Jensen, Emma Hvidtfeldt; Solarino, Amelie; Jensen, Margit Bak] Aarhus Univ, Dept Anim & Vet Sci, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Neave, HW (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Anim Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",hwneave@gmail.com,"Neave, Heather/LQK-1489-2024","Jensen, Margit Bak/0000-0001-7982-582X; Jensen, Emma Hvidtfeldt/0000-0002-1478-2870","Independent Research Fund Denmark (Odense, Denmark) [0136-00253B]","Independent Research Fund Denmark (Odense, Denmark)(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF))","We thank all barn staff, technicians, and students who assisted with manage-ment and data collection.

Liver and blood samples were collected from healthy dairy cows (n = 10; hepatic triglyceride content <1% wet weight) and cows with mild FL (n = 10; 1% <= hepatic triglyceride content < 5% wet weight) or moderate FL (n = 10; 5% <= hepatic triglyceride content < 10% wet weight) that had a similar number of lactations (median = 3, range = 2-4) and days in milk (median = 6 d, range = 3-9). Blood parameters were determined using a Hitachi 3130 autoanalyzer with commercially available kits. Protein and mRNA abundances were determined using western blotting and quantitative real -time PCR, respectively. Activities of calcineurin and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase were measured with commercial assay kits. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with subsequent Bonferroni correction. Blood concentrations of glucose were lower in moderate FL cows (3.03 +/- 0.21 m M ) than in healthy (3.71 +/- 0.14 m M ) and mild FL cows (3.76 +/- 0.14 m M ). Blood concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB, 1.37 +/- 0.15 m M in mild FL, 1.88 +/- 0.17 m M in moderate FL) and free fatty acids (FFA, 0.69 +/- 0.05 m M in mild FL, 0.96 +/- 0.09 m M in moderate FL) were greater in FL cows than in healthy cows (BHB, 0.76 +/- 0.12 m M ; FFA, 0.42 +/- 0.04 m M ). Compared with healthy cows, phosphorylation of AMPK was greater and phosphorylation of its downstream target acetylCoA carboxylase 1 was lower in cows with mild and moderate FL. Phosphorylation of mTOR was lower in cows with mild FL compared with healthy cows. In cows with moderate FL, phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream effectors was greater than in healthy cows and cows with mild FL. The mRNA abundance of TFEB was downregulated in cows with moderate FL compared with healthy cows and mild FL cows. In mild FL cows, the mRNA and protein abundances of TFEB were greater than in healthy cows. Compared with healthy cows, the mRNA abundances of autophagy markers sequestosome-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 -II, and the protein and mRNA abundances of lysosome -associated membrane protein 1 and cathepsin D were increased in mild FL cows but decreased in moderate FL cows. Compared with healthy cows, the mRNA abundance of mucolipin 1 and activities of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and calcineurin were higher in cows with mild FL but lower in cows with moderate FL. These data demonstrate that hepatic AMPK signaling pathway, TFEB transcriptional activity, and autophagy-lysosomal function are increased in dairy cows with mild FL; the hepatic mTORC1 signaling pathway is inhibited in mild FL cows but activated in moderate FL cows; and activities of AMPK and TFEB as well as autophagy-lysosomal function are impaired in moderate FL cows.","[Du, Xiliang; Chen, Meng; Fang, Zhiyuan; Shao, Qi; Yu, Hao; Hao, Xue; Gao, Xinxing; Ju, Lingxue; Li, Chenxu; Yang, Yuting; Song, Yuxiang; Lei, Lin; Liu, Guowen; Li, Xinwei] Jilin Univ, State Key Lab Diag & Treatment Severe Zoonot Infec, Key Lab Zoonosis Res, Minist Educ,Inst Zoonosis, Changchun 130062, Peoples R China; Jilin Univ, Coll Vet Med, Changchun 130062, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Jilin University,"Li, XW (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, State Key Lab Diag & Treatment Severe Zoonot Infec, Key Lab Zoonosis Res, Minist Educ,Inst Zoonosis, Changchun 130062, Peoples R China.",lixinwei100@126.com,"LEI, Lin/JAN-6074-2023; Yang, Yuting/MEO-9352-2025",,"National Key R&D Program of China (Beijing, China) [2023YFD1801400]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Changchun, China) [2022-JCXK-21]","National Key R&D Program of China (Beijing, China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Changchun, China)","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Beijing, China; grant no. 2023YFD1801400) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Changchun, China; grant no. 2022-JCXK-21) .

Furthermore, it is necessary to verify the practical effectiveness of the LOGISITC and SV (support vector machine) models for modeling cow estrus. In this paper, we have proposed a non-contact cow estrus monitoring method based on the thermal infrared images of cows and have proposed a lab-color-space-based feature extraction method for the thermal infrared images of cow eyes and vulvas. The test subjects were 10 Holstein cows, monitored on a fixed basis, to determine the best segmentation contour. The LOGISTIC and SVM (support vector machine) models were used to establish the cow estrus model using the thermal infrared temperature variation in cows in estrus and cows not in estrus. The experimental results showed that the heat detection rate of the LOGISTIC-based model was 82.37% and the heat detection rate of the SVM-based model was 81.42% under the optimal segmentation profile. The highest temperature in the eye and vulva of cows was the input, and the recall rate was above 86%. The heat monitoring method based on thermal infrared images does not cause stress to cows and meets the needs of modern dairy farming for welfare breeding.","[Wang, Zhen; Wang, Shuai; Wang, Chunguang; Zhang, Yong; Zong, Zheying; Su, Lide; Du, Yingjie] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Hohhot 010018, Peoples R China; [Wang, Haichao] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Energy & Transportat Engn, Hohhot 010018, Peoples R China",Inner Mongolia Agricultural University; Inner Mongolia Agricultural University,"Zong, ZY (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Hohhot 010018, Peoples R China.",zongzheying@imau.edu.cn,,,Inner Mongolia Talent Development Fund; Key Projects of the Department of Education of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region [NJZZ22509],Inner Mongolia Talent Development Fund; Key Projects of the Department of Education of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,This research was funded by the Inner Mongolia Talent Development Fund and Key Projects of the Department of Education of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (No. NJZZ22509).,,40,20,22,7,31,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,FEB,2023,13.0,2.0,,,,,,,385.0,10.3390/agriculture13020385,0,,,19,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,9G4WB,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-15,WOS:000938153900001,0,cows

Control cows received the first artificial insemination at fixed time (TAI; primiparous, herd 1 = 82 and herd 2 = 83 DIM; multiparous, herd 1 = 68 and herd 2 = 69 DIM) following the Double-Ovsynch (DOV) protocol. Cows enrolled in the TRM treatment were managed as follows: (1) cows with at least one intense estrus were inseminated upon AMD detected estrus for 42 d and, if not inseminated, were enrolled in the DOV protocol; and (2) cows without an intense estrus were enrolled in the DOV protocol at the same time as cows in the con-trol treatment. Control cows were re-inseminated based on visual or patch aided detection of estrus, whereas TRM cows were re-inseminated as described for control cows with the aid of the AMD. Cows received a GnRH injection 27 & PLUSMN; 3 d after insemination and, if diagnosed as nonpregnant, completed the 5-d Cosynch protocol and received TAI 35 & PLUSMN; 3 d after insemination. Among cows in the TRM treatment, 55.8 and 42.9% of primip-arous and multiparous cows, respectively, received the first insemination in spontaneous estrus. The interac-tion between treatment and parity affected pregnancy 67 d after the first AI (primiparous: control = 37.6%, TRM = 27.4%; multiparous: control = 41.0%, TRM = 44.7%). The TRM treatment increased re-insemination in estrus (control = 48.3%, TRM = 70.5%). Pregnancy 67 d after re-inseminations tended to be affected by the interaction between treatment and EPEC (no intense estrus: control = 25.3%, TRM = 32.0%; intense es-trus: control = 32.9%, TRM = 32.2%). The interaction between treatment and EPEC affected pregnancy by 305 DIM (no intense estrus: control = 80.8%, TRM = 88.2%; intense estrus: control = 87.1%, TRM = 86.1%). Treatment did not affect the number of reproductive hormone treatments among cows that had not had an intense estrus (control = 10.5 & PLUSMN; 0.3, TRM = 9.1 & PLUSMN; 0.2 treatments/cow), but cows in the TRM treatment that had an intense estrus received fewer reproductive hormone treatments than cows in the control treatment (2.0 & PLUSMN; 0.1 vs. 9.6 & PLUSMN; 0.2 treatments/cow). Selecting multiparous cows for first AI in estrus based on EPEC reduced the use of reproductive hormones without im-pairing the likelihood of pregnancy to first AI. The use of AMD for re-insemination expedited the establish-ment of pregnancy among cows that did not display an intense estrus early postpartum.","[Gonzalez, Tomas D.; Factor, Luana; Mirzaei, Ahmadreza; Montevecchio, Ana B.; Casaro, Segundo; Merenda, Victoria R.; Prim, Jessica G.; Galvao, Klibs N.; Bisinotto, Rafael S.; Chebel, Ricardo C.] Univ Florida, Dept Large Anim Clin Sci, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Chebel, Ricardo C.] Univ Florida, Dept Anim Sci, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Chebel, RC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Large Anim Clin Sci, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.;Chebel, RC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Anim Sci, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",rcchebel@ufl.edu,"Merenda, Victoria/AAY-4331-2020; Mirzaei, Ahmadreza/PAV-3751-2025","Gonzalez, Tomas D/0000-0002-2787-4627;",,,,,34,16,21,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0022-0302,1525-3198,,J DAIRY SCI,J.

Milk samples were taken from Holstein-Friesian cows from four dairy farms in Lublin Province. The bacteriological examination of the milk was performed and the somatic cells count in 1 mL of milk was determined using a SomaCount FC automatic cell counter. Determination of TP, CAS, LAC, FAT and FA levels in milk was carried out using a DairySpec FT automated Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Results: Total protein in milk from HE was significantly higher than in milk from cows with mastitis (4.04% vs 3.57% in milk from SCM cows and 3.7% in milk from CM cows, P = 0.001). The CAS level was 2.73% in milk from CM cows and 2.92% in milk from SCM cows vs 3.30% in milk from HE cows, P = 0.001. The changes in CAS and TP in milk resulted in a significant difference in the CAS/TP ratio (81.7% in milk from HE cows vs 73.8% in milk from CM cows). A decrease in levels was also recorded for LAC (4.8% in milk from HE cows vs 4.51% in milk from SCM cows and 4.01% in milk from CM cows, P = 0.001). The fat level was significantly higher in milk from healthy cows than in milk from cows with mastitis (4.0% vs 2.3% in milk from SCM cows and 1.64% in milk from CM cows, P = 0.001). Conclusion: It should be emphasised that the decrease in the levels of TP, LAC and FAT was significant not only in milk from CM cows but also in milk from SCM cows. This is very unfavourable, because the reduction in the main milk components results in poor quality dairy products and impairs line processes.","[Bochniarz, Mariola; Szczubial, Marek; Wochnik, Marco; Dabrowski, Roman] Univ Life Sci, Fac Vet Med, Dept Clin Anim Reprod, PL-20612 Lublin, Poland; [Blaszczyk, Przemyslaw] Prevent Vet Practice, PL-09304 Lubowidz, Poland; [Vasiu, Iosif] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Cluj Napoca 400372, Romania; [Adaszek, Lukasz; Michalak, Katarzyna; Pietras-Ozga, Dorota] Univ Life Sci, Fac Vet Med, Dept Epizootiol & Clin Infect Dis, PL-20612 Lublin, Poland",University of Agricultural Sciences & Veterinary Medicine Cluj Napoca,"Bochniarz, M (corresponding author), Univ Life Sci, Fac Vet Med, Dept Clin Anim Reprod, PL-20612 Lublin, Poland.",mariolabochniarz@interia.pl,"; VASIU, Iosif/AAA-7594-2022; Dabrowski, Roman/ABG-1955-2020","Vasiu, Iosif/0000-0001-6788-411X; PIETRAS-OZGA, DOROTA/0000-0002-1580-9254; Wochnik, Marco/0000-0002-0258-1086",,,,,35,12,12,6,21,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",2450-7393,2450-8608,,J VET RES,J.

Therefore, understanding social interac-tions in groups of dairy cows is important to enhance herd management and optimize the outcomes of both animal health and welfare in the future. Many factors can affect the number of social contacts in a group. This study aimed to identify which characteristics of a cow are associated with the number of contacts it has with other group members in 2 different functional areas (feeding and resting area) to increase our under-standing of the social behavior of dairy cows. Inside 2 herds housed in freestall barns with around 200 lactat-ing cows each, cow positions were recorded with an ultra-wideband real-time location system collecting all cows' positions every second over 2 wk. Using the posi-tioning data of the cows, we quantified the number of contacts between them, assuming that cows spending time in proximity to one another (within a distance of 2.5 m for at least 10 min per day) were interact-ing socially. We documented in which barn areas these interactions occurred and used linear mixed models to investigate if lactation stage, parity, breed, pregnancy status, estrus, udder health, and claw health affect the number of contacts. We found variation in the num-ber of contacts a cow had between individuals in both functional areas. Cows in later lactation had more con-tacts in the feeding area than cows in early lactation. Furthermore, in one herd, higher parity cows had fewer contacts in the feeding area than first parity cows, and in the other herd, cows in third parity or higher had more contacts in the resting area. This study indicates that cow characteristics such as parity and days in milk are associated with the number of contacts a cow has daily to its herd mates and provides useful information for further research on social interactions of dairy cows.","[Hansson, I.; Silvera, A.; Ren, K.; Ronnegard, L.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Anim Breeding & Genet, Box 7023, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Woudstra, S.] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Dept Vet & Anim Sci, DK-1870 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Skarin, A.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Anim Nutr & Management, Box 7024, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Fikse, W.

A total of 3,750 lactat-ing Holstein cows (1,563 primiparous cows and 2,187 multiparous cows) from a commercial dairy farm in Slovakia calving from January 2020 until July 2021 were enrolled on an ongoing basis. Activity data were recorded from d 7 until d 60 postpartum. Within this observational period, cows were classified into 3 cate-gories: (1) no estrus event (Estrus0), (2) 1 estrus event (Estrus1), or (3) 2 or more estrus events (Estrus2+). Transition cow health was assessed by farm personnel within the first 30 d in milk (DIM) using standard operating procedures. Generalized linear mixed mod-els were used to analyze continuous and categorical data. Cox proportional hazard models were used for time to event data. The overall prevalence of anes-trus was 20.8%. Multiparous cows had a greater risk for anestrus compared with primiparous cows [odds ratio (OR) = 1.4]. Cows with stillbirth (OR = 1.76), retained placenta (OR = 2.19), puerperal metritis (OR = 1.48), or subclinical ketosis (OR = 1.51) had a greater risk for anestrus. In addition, cows calving in summer (OR = 0.82), autumn (OR = 0.38), or winter (OR = 0.56) had a higher incidence of anestrus than cows calving in spring. Estrous expression from d 7 until d 60 postpartum was associated with estrous duration (DU) and estrous intensity at first artificial insemination (AI). Cows in Estrus0 had the shortest DU at first postpartum AI (9.4 +/- 0.18 h) compared with cows in Estrus1 (10.5 +/- 0.13 h) and Estrus2+(11.4 +/- 0.12 h). Cows in Estrus2+ had a longer DU at first postpartum AI compared with cows in Estrus1. For Estrus0, Estrus1, and Estrus2+ cows, pregnancy per AI at first service was 42.5%, 50.9%, and 55.4%, respectively. Estrous expression from d 7 until d 60 postpartum was associated with time to first AI and time to pregnancy. Compared with Estrus0 cows, Es-trus1 [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.43] and Estrus2+ cows (HR = 1.62) had an increased hazard of being insemi-nated within 100 DIM. Compared with Estrus2+, Es-trus1 cows had a reduced hazard of being inseminated within 100 DIM (HR = 0.89). Compared with Estrus0 cows, Estrus1 (HR = 1.24) and Estrus2+ cows (HR = 1.46) had an increased hazard of becoming pregnant within 200 DIM. Median DIM to pregnancy were 121, 96, and 92 for Estrus0, Estrus1, and Estrus2+ cows, respectively. In conclusion, cows with transition cow disorders (i.e., stillbirth, retained placenta, puerperal metritis, or subclinical ketosis) had a greater chance for anestrus compared with healthy cows. Cows in Estrus0 had reduced estrous expression at first AI and inferior reproductive performance compared with cows that displayed estrous activity from d 7 until d 60.","[Bretzinger, L.

One important aspect of such a system is the ability to identify individual cows and estimate their feeding time. In this study, we propose a method for achieving this goal through facial region analysis. We used a YOLO detector to extract the cow head region from video images captured during feeding with the head region cropped as a face region image. The face region image was used for cow identification and transfer learning was employed for identification. In the context of cow identification, transfer learning can be used to train a pre-existing deep neural network to recognize individual cows based on their unique physical characteristics, such as their head shape, markings, or ear tags. To estimate the time of feeding, we divided the feeding area into vertical strips for each cow and established a horizontal line just above the feeding materials to determine whether a cow was feeding or not by using Hough transform techniques. We tested our method using real-life data from a large farm, and the experimental results showed promise in achieving our objectives. This approach has the potential to diagnose diseases and movement disorders in cows and could provide valuable insights for farmers.","[Kawagoe, Yusei; Zin, Thi Thi] Univ Miyazaki, Grad Sch Engn, Miyazaki 8892192, Japan; [Kobayashi, Ikuo] Univ Miyazaki, Fac Agr, Field Sci Ctr, Miyazaki 8892192, Japan",University of Miyazaki; University of Miyazaki,"Zin, TT (corresponding author), Univ Miyazaki, Grad Sch Engn, Miyazaki 8892192, Japan.",thithi@cc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp,,,JKA through its promotion funds from KEIRIN RACE,JKA through its promotion funds from KEIRIN RACE,This publication was subsidized by JKA through its promotion funds from KEIRIN RACE.,,25,11,12,0,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0472,,AGRICULTURE-BASEL,Agriculture-Basel,MAY 6,2023,13.0,5.0,,,,,,,1016.0,10.3390/agriculture13051016,0,,,15,Agronomy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,H4DE9,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-15,WOS:000995479400001,0,cows

The following traits were evaluated: first service conception rate (FSCR), overall concep-tion rate (CR), number of services per conception (SC), days open (DO), mortality rate, culling rate, survival to subsequent calvings, and length of productive life (LPL). The data set consisted of 506 lactations from 240 SxH crossbred cows and 1,331 lactations from 576 HOL cows. The FSCR and CR were analyzed using logistic regression, DO and LPL were analyzed using a Cox's proportional hazards regression model, and dif-ferences of proportions were calculated for mortality rate, culling rate, and survival to subsequent calvings. The SxH cows were superior to HOL cows in overall lactations for all the fertility traits (+10.5% FSCR, +7.7% CR, -0.5 SC, and 35 fewer DO). During the first lactation, SxH cows were superior to HOL cows for all fertility traits (+12.8% FSCR, +8.0% CR, -0.4 SC, and 34 fewer DO). In the second lactation, SxH cows exhibited lower SC (-0.5) and 21 fewer DO than HOL cows. In the third or greater lactations, SxH cows showed higher FSCR (+11.0%) and CR (+12.2%), lower SC (-0.8), and 44 fewer DO than pure HOL cows. In addition, SxH cows had a lower mortality rate (-4.7%) and a lower culling rate (-13.7%) than HOL cows. Due to the higher fertility and lower mortality and culling rates, the SxH cows had higher survival to the second (+9.2%), third (+16.9%), and fourth (+18.7%) calvings than HOL cows. Because of these results, SxH cows had longer LPL (+10.3 mo) than HOL cows.

Pregnancy diagnosis was performed on a weekly basis by transrectal ultrasound (farms 1, 3, 7, 8) or by transrectal palpation (farms 2, 4-6, 9). Estrous intensity was represented by the peak value of the change in activity. In experiment 1, PA was categorized into low (x-factor 0-20) and high (x-factor 21-100) PA, and in experiment 2 into low (activity change = 35-89) and high (activity change = 90-100) PA. In TAI cows from both experiments, PA was additionally categorized into cows with no AAM alert. Data were analyzed separately for AAM and TAI cows using multinomial logistic regression models for PA in TAI cows and logistic regression models for PA in AAM cows and P/AI in both groups. In experiment 1, P/AI of AAM cows was greater for AI services performed with conventional frozen semen (57.6%) compared with sexed semen (47.2%), whereas type of semen only tended to be associated with P/AI in TAI cows (54.4% conventional frozen semen vs. 48.9% sexed semen). In experiment 2, P/AI was greater for fresh semen (AAM cows: 44.4% vs. TAI cows: 44.2%) compared with conventional frozen semen (AAM cows: 37.6% vs. TAI cows: 34.6%). In both experiments, pregnancy out-comes were associated with PA. In experiment 1, AAM cows with high PA (55.1%) had greater P/AI than cows with low PA (49.8%). Within TAI cows, cows with no alert (38.8%) had reduced P/AI compared with cows with low (54.2%) or high PA (61.8%). In experiment 2, AAM cows with high PA (45.8%) had greater P/ AI compared with cows with low PA (36.4%). Timed AI cows with no alert (27.4%) had decreased P/AI compared with cows with low (41.1%) or high (50.8%) PA. The greatest risk factors for high PA were parity (experiment 1) and season of AI (except for TAI cows from experiment 1). We conclude that high PA at the time of AI is associated with greater odds of pregnancy for both AAM and TAI cows. In both experiments, about 2 thirds of AAM cows (experiment 1: 69.9% and experiment 2: 70.7%) reached high PA, whereas only approximately one-third or less of TAI cows (experi-ment 1: 37.3% and experiment 2: 23.6%) showed high PA. Although we observed similar results using 2 dif-ferent AAM systems for the most part, risk factors for high PA might differ between farms and insemination type (i.e., AAM vs. TAI).","[Tippenhauer, C.

Therefore, relieving the heat stress of dairy cows is an important priority for the dairy industry. Plant extracts have advantages in safety, efficiency, low toxic side effects (if correctly selected) and residue, thus, can significantly aid in alleviating heat stress in dairy cows. This paper reviews the effects of some plant extracts on alleviating heat stress in dairy cows and their possible regulatory mechanisms. The aim is to develop applicable strategies using plant extracts to alleviate heat stress in dairy cows. Heat stress (HS) in cows is a critical issue in the dairy industry. Dairy cows accumulate heat from body metabolism, along with that imposed by air temperature, humidity, air flow and solar radiation. HS in animals can occur during hot and humid summers when the ambient temperature is extremely high. Dairy cows have relatively high feed intakes and metabolic heat production and are thus susceptible to HS, leading to reductions in feed intake, lower milk yield, affected milk quality, reduced animal health and even shortening the productive lifespan of cows. Therefore, alleviating HS is a top priority for the dairy industry. Suitable plant extracts have advantages in safety, efficiency and few toxic side effects or residues for applications to alleviate HS in dairy cows. This paper reviews the effects of some plant extract products on alleviating HS in dairy cows and briefly discusses their possible mechanisms of action.","[Guo, Yongmei; Li, Li; Yan, Sumei; Shi, Binlin] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci, Key Lab Anim Nutr & Feed Sci Univ Inner Mongolia A, Hohhot 010018, Peoples R China",Inner Mongolia Agricultural University,"Yan, SM (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci, Key Lab Anim Nutr & Feed Sci Univ Inner Mongolia A, Hohhot 010018, Peoples R China.",yansmimau@163.com,"; Yan, Sumei/GQP-7501-2022","Shi, Binlin/0000-0002-8550-3509; Guo, Yongmei/0000-0002-5533-9496",Inner Mongolia Natural Science Foundation [2022QN03016]; Program for Improving the Scientific Research Ability of Youth Teachers of Inner Mongolia Agricultural University [BR220142],Inner Mongolia Natural Science Foundation; Program for Improving the Scientific Research Ability of Youth Teachers of Inner Mongolia Agricultural University,This work was supported by grants from the Inner Mongolia Natural Science Foundation(Project No. 2022QN03016) and the Program for Improving the Scientific Research Ability of Youth Teachers of Inner Mongolia Agricultural University (Project No. BR220142).,,111,9,10,7,47,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,SEP,2023,13.0,18.0,,,,,,,2831.0,10.3390/ani13182831,0,,,11,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,S6WJ1,37760231.0,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-15,WOS:001072547500001,0,cows

In total, 3800 Holstein singleton cows (2000 heifers and 1800 cows) from two commercial dairy farms were used. The average gestation length for 3800 cows was 276 +/- 6 d. Cows with GL shorter or longer than 3 SD from the mean were removed and considered outliers. This process led to the elimination of 20 cows from the 3800 cows enrolled in the study. Therefore, 3780 cows (1994 heifers and 1786 cows) remained for data analysis, with a range of GL between 258 and 294 d. The mean of GL for the remaining 3780 cows in the study was 276 +/- 5 d, which were classified as short (SGL; more than 1SD less than the population mean, mean = 267, range 258-270 d), average (AGL; population mean +/- 1SD, mean = 276, range 271 -281 d), and long (LGL; more than 1SD greater than the population mean, mean = 284, range 282 -294 d) gestation length. In primiparous cows, the incidence of stillbirth, retained placenta, metritis, and clinical endometritis were higher in the SGL cows than in the AGL cows, but the incidence of dystocia was similar across groups. In multiparous cows, the incidence of dystocia, retained placenta, and metritis were higher in the SGL cows than in the AGL cows, and the incidence of stillbirth was higher in the SGL and LGL cows than in the AGL cows. In primiparous cows, milk yield was not different across groups. However, in multiparous cows, the SGL cows had lower milk yield than the AGL cows. In primiparous cows, the SGL cows had lower colostrum production than the AGL cows, but in multiparous cows, there was no difference in colostrum production across groups. In general, cows with either short or long gestation length had impaired health and production, but this impact was more pronounced in cows with short gestation length.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesised that a faster transition from fresh-cow diet (higher forage:concentrate) to lactation-cow diet (lower forage:concentrate), combined with supplementation of fresh-cow diet with RPG will have positive effects on production and health of dairy cows. ObjectivesTo investigate the immediate and long-term effects of length of stay in fresh-cow diet and supplementation with RPG on productive and reproductive performance of high-producing dairy cows. MethodsA total of 264 multiparous Holstein cows (average parity +/- standard deviation = 3.2 +/- 1.3, ranging from 2 to 6) were used in a 2 x 2 factorially arranged trial. Treatments were the feeding duration of a fresh-cow diet for 14 or 21 days, each combined by daily supplementation of the fresh-cow diet with ground corn grain or RPG product top dressed at 500 g/day/head. ResultsThe earlier transition from fresh-cow to lactation diet resulted in greater milk production from 15 through 21 days in milk (DIM; by 2.28 kg/day), and also fat-corrected milk production on 30 and 60 DIM, respectively. Corn grain or RPG supplementation did not affect the average milk production (1 to 21 DIM), as well as milk production and composition on 30 and 60 DIM. Although extent of body condition loss at transition tended to be lesser in cows switching faster to lactation diet, these cows lost more body condition from 30 to 90 DIM. Survival analysis on calving-to-conception interval and time to removal from herd did not find any significant difference across treatments. ConclusionsThe positive effects of earlier transition from fresh-cow to lactation diet were evident by greater milk production from 15 through 21 DIM, and fat-corrected milk production (30 and 60 DIM), at the expense of body condition in high-producing dairy cows. A daily topdress of RPG on fresh-cow diet had no immediate or carryover effects on production of dairy cows.","[Beiranvand, H.; Babajanzade-Sorati, S.] Chaltasian Agrianim Prod Co, Tehran, Iran; [Ahmadi, F.] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Green Bio Sci & Technol, Dept Ecofriendly Livestock Sci, Pyeongchang, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Alamouti, Ali A.

Lameness, a prevalent health disorder in dairy cows, is commonly detected by analyzing the gait of cows. A cow's gait can be tracked in videos using pose estimation models because models learn to automatically localize anatomical landmarks in images and videos. Most animal pose estimation models are static, that is, videos are processed frame by frame and do not use any temporal information. In this work, a static deep-learning model for animal-pose-estimation was extended to a temporal model that includes information from past frames. We compared the performance of the static and temporal pose estimation models. The data consisted of 1059 samples of 4 consecutive frames extracted from videos (30 fps) of 30 different dairy cows walking through an outdoor passageway. As farm environments are prone to occlusions, we tested the robustness of the static and temporal models by adding artificial occlusions to the videos. The experiments showed that, on non-occluded data, both static and temporal approaches achieved a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCKh@0.2) of 99%. On occluded data, our temporal approach outperformed the static one by up to 32.9%, suggesting that using temporal data was beneficial for pose estimation in environments prone to occlusions, such as dairy farms. The generalization capabilities of the temporal model was evaluated by testing it on data containing unknown cows (cows not present in the training set). The results showed that the average PCKh@0.2 was of 93.8% on known cows and 87.6% on unknown cows, indicating that the model was capable of generalizing well to new cows and that they could be easily fine-tuned to new herds. Finally, we showed that with harder tasks, such as occlusions and unknown cows, a deeper architecture was more beneficial.","[Russello, Helena; Tol, Rik van der; Kootstra, Gert] Wageningen Univ & Res, Farm Technol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Russello, H (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Farm Technol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",helena@russello.dev; rik.vandertol@wur.nl; gert.kootstra@wur.nl,,,,,,,27,40,42,4,43,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,London,"125 London Wall, London, ENGLAND",0168-1699,1872-7107,,COMPUT ELECTRON AGR,Comput.

The objective of this study was to assess the main bacteria related to cases of CE and SCE from uterine samples of dairy cows in Brazilian herds. Selective and differential media were used for isolation of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and further MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) identification. A total of 279 lactating dairy cows with 28 to 33 d in milk from 6 commercial farms were evaluated. Initially, cows were classified in 3 groups: cytologic healthy cows (n = 161), cows with CE (n = 83), and cows with SCE (n = 35). Healthy animals presented 97 species, followed by the CE group with 53 identified species, and SCE cows presented only 21 bacterial species. We found a significantly higher isolation rate of Trueperella pyogenes in CE (26.5%) cows compared with healthy and SCE cows. Some anaerobic species were exclusively isolated from the CE group, even though they presented lower frequency. Interestingly, 18.1% of samples from CE cows and 40% of SCE cows were negative to bacterial isolation. Despite the use of culture-dependent methods instead of molecular methods, the present study enabled the identification of a complex community of 127 different species from 48 genera, composed of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species among the 3 different animal groups. The method of sample collection, culture, and identification by MALDI-TOF MS were essential for the success of the analyses.","[Paiano, R. B.; Pugliesi, G.; Baruselli, P.

Until now, the welfare-husbandry conditions of rabbits in correlation with owner attachment to the rabbit has never been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the bond with a rabbit and selected factors, such as ownership of a dog and/or cat, the time spent with the rabbit, and the age of any children living in the household, have an impact on a pet rabbit's husbandry conditions. Data was gathered on the basis of a questionnaire survey conducted among pet rabbit owners in the Czech Republic. In total, 1651 completed questionnaires were collected through various channels, namely veterinary surgeries, pet shops, breeders, and social media. The questions covered demographics, living conditions, the presence of children and/or other pets, and the strength of the bond. We found that living with a child/children under 12 years of age, owning a dog and a cat, and spending less time with the rabbit were associated with a decreased bond between the owner and the rabbit. It was also found that decreased time spent with the rabbit is associated with decreased animal husbandry conditions. However, only a weak association was found between the bond of the owners to their rabbit and its welfare-husbandry conditions. Overall, the most alarming finding was that over 80% of companion rabbits in Czech Republic are kept in isolation. In conclusion, the amount of time owners spend with their rabbit appears to be a suitable parameter for determining the strength of the bond attachment and husbandry conditions of the rabbit. There were minimal differences between the strength of the bond and the breeding status of the rabbit if there was a child and/or other pets such as a dog and/or cat in the household. The role of rabbits has changed recently, and it is therefore necessary to conduct comprehensive research into rabbit welfare.","[Pribylova, Lucie; Souckova, Michaela; Vostra-Vydrova, Hana; Chaloupkova, Helena] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Ethol & Compan Anim Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic; [Kolarova, Martina Fruehauf] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Vet Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Pribylová, L (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Ethol & Compan Anim Sci, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic.",pribylova@af.czu.cz,"Součková, Michaela/JTS-4754-2023; Frühauf Kolářová, Martina/JVO-4430-2024; Chaloupková, Helena/A-7683-2019; Pribylova, Lucie/AAW-1778-2021","Přibylová, Lucie/0000-0002-7094-2111;",,,,,98,8,8,7,26,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0168-1591,1872-9045,,APPL ANIM BEHAV SCI,Appl.

Both parasites shed environmentally robust environmental stages (oo/cysts) and have been responsible for numerous waterborne outbreaks of diseases. Cryptosporidium hominis and C. parvum are responsible for most infections in humans, while Giardia duodenalis assemblages A and B, cause most human cases of giardiasis. Cryptosporidium cuniculus, the dominant species infecting rabbits, is the only spceies other than C. hominis and C. parvum to have caused a waterborne outbreak of gastritis, which occurred in the United Kingdom in 2008. This review examines the prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia species in rabbits to better understand the public health risks of contamination of water sources with Cryptosporidium and Giardia oo/cysts from rabbits. Despite the abundance of C. cuniculus in rabbits, reports in humans are relatively rare, with the exception of the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and reports of C. cuniculus in humans from the United Kingdom have declined substantially since the 2008 outbreak. Subtyping of C. cuniculus has supported the potential for zoonotic transmission. Relatively few studies have been conducted on Giardia, but assemblage B dominates. However, improved typing methods are required to better understand the transmission dynamics of Giardia assemblages in rabbits. Similarly, it is not well understood if pet rabbits or contaminated water are the main source of C. cuniculus infections in humans. Well-planned studies using high-resolution typing tools are required to understand the transmission dynamics better and quantify the public health risk of Cryptosporidium and Giardia from rabbits.","[Egan, Siobhon; Barbosa, Amanda D.; Ryan, Una] Murdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Vector & Water Borne Pathogen Res Grp, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [Barbosa, Amanda D.] Minist Educ Brazil, CAPES Fdn, BR-70040020 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Feng, Yaoyu; Xiao, Lihua] South China Agr Univ, Coll Vet Med, Ctr Emerging & Zoonot Dis, Guangdong Lab Lingnan Modern Agr, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China",Murdoch University; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES); Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture; South China Agricultural University,"Egan, S (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Vector & Water Borne Pathogen Res Grp, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.",siobhon.egan@murdoch.edu.au,"Barbosa, Amanda/W-5811-2019; Xiao, Lihua/B-1704-2013; Egan, Siobhon/HPF-6630-2023; Ryan, Una/B-7224-2015; Feng, Yaoyu/B-3076-2014","Xiao, Lihua/0000-0001-8532-2727; Egan, Siobhon/0000-0003-4395-4069; Ryan, Una/0000-0003-2710-9324",Water RA project [1156]; The 111 Project of China [D20008],"Water RA project; The 111 Project of China(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)",This research was funded by Water RA project number 1156 and the 111 Project of China (D20008) .,,106,7,8,6,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-4017,1873-2550,,VET PARASITOL,Vet.

A total of 120 healthy New Zealand weaned rabbits with similar initial body weight, were randomly divided into 3 treatments with 20 replicates per treatment and 2 weaned rabbits per replicate: control (CON) group (rabbits were housed at 25 +/- 1(degrees)C and fed a basal diet), HS group (rabbits were housed at 35 +/- 1(degrees)C and fed a basal diet), and HS + CGA group (rabbits were housed at 35 +/- 1 degrees C and fed a basal diet supplemented with 800 mg/kg CGA). The trial lasted for 28 days. The results showed that HS challenge decreased (p < 0.05) growth performance, induced oxidative stress and hepatic apoptosis, and caused liver damage in rabbits. However, dietary CGA supplementation increased (p < 0.05) body weight gain and feed efficiency, and enhanced (p < 0.05) antioxidative capacity in serum and liver in HS-challenged rabbits; attenuated HS-induced increases in urea nitrogen (p = 0.03), alanine aminotransferase (p = 0.03), aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.01), caspase-8 (p = 0.02), and caspase-3 (p = 0.04) as well as decrease albumin (p = 0.04). Moreover, supplementation with CGA upregulated Nrf2/HO-1 pathway-related genes expressions, including Nrf2 (p = 0.009), HO-1 (p = 0.03) and SOD1 (p = 0.04) in HS-challenged rabbits. Our findings demonstrated that dietary CGA supplementation could alleviate HS-induced decline in growth performance, and protect against HS-induced liver damage partially through enhancing antioxidant capacity via acting Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and inhibiting hepatic apoptosis in rabbits.","[Ji, Rongmei; Chen, Jiali; Xu, Jian; Zhang, Lirui; Liu, Lei; Li, Fuchang] Shandong Agr Univ, Key Lab Efficient Utilizat Nongrain Feed Resources, Minist & Prov, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs,Shandong Prov Key Lab A, Tai An 271018, Peoples R China",Shandong Agricultural University,"Chen, JL; Li, FC (corresponding author), Shandong Agr Univ, Key Lab Efficient Utilizat Nongrain Feed Resources, Minist & Prov, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs,Shandong Prov Key Lab A, Tai An 271018, Peoples R China.",jlchen@sdau.edu.cn; chlf@sdau.edu.cn,,"Li, Fuchang/0000-0002-5670-8038",Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; Special Economic Animal Industry Technology System of Shandong Province [SDAIT-21-16]; Agricultural Seed Improvement Project of Shandong Province [2021LZGC002]; Science and Technology Project of West Coast New District of Qingdao [2021-17]; [ZR2021QC108]; [ZR2021MC043]; [CARS-43-B-1],Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Special Economic Animal Industry Technology System of Shandong Province; Agricultural Seed Improvement Project of Shandong Province; Science and Technology Project of West Coast New District of Qingdao; ; ;,The authors are grateful for the support by Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2021QC108 and ZR2021MC043); the earmarked fund for CARS (CARS-43-B-1); Special Economic Animal Industry Technology System of Shandong Province (SDAIT-21-16); Agricultural Seed Improvement Project of Shandong Province (2021LZGC002); and Science and Technology Project of West Coast New District of Qingdao in 2021 (List Announcing System Special Project in Science and Technology Research) (2021-17).,,53,7,7,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0931-2439,1439-0396,,J ANIM PHYSIOL AN N,J.

However, how the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) adapts to different predator pressure is not fully known. Here, we studied the adaptive anti-predatory responses of European rabbits exposed to different terrestrial predation pressure. To do this, we took advantage of a rabbit translocation programme in the Sierra Norte Natural Park of Sevilla (SW Spain), where rabbits from the same donor population were translocated in plots with and without terrestrial predator exclusion fences (aerial predation was not excluded in any of the plots). This presented an ideal opportunity to observe whether the behaviour of individuals from the same population adapts to situations with different predator pressure; thus, their behaviour was evaluated through direct observations. Although most rabbits were observed close to cover, differences in distance to cover, group size and behaviour were observed between fenced and unfenced plots. Overall, both adult and juvenile rabbits moved further from cover in the unfenced plot than in the fenced plot. Most of the observations in the unfenced plot corresponded to rabbits in pairs or alone; whereas in the fenced plot, rabbits were primarily in pairs or in larger groups. Our findings suggest that in the unfenced plot, rabbits that moved further from cover were often part of larger groups (>= 4 rabbits); whereas in the fenced plot, it was rabbits in smaller groups (< 4 rabbits). Rabbits in the unfenced plot were alert and running more frequently than rabbits in the fenced one; in the latter, these rabbits were mostly feeding. Other relaxed behaviours such us grooming or resting were more frequent close to cover. In summary, our results highlight rabbits' capacity to promptly adjust behaviour in response to predation risk, exhibiting adaptive anti-predatory responses tailored to different predation pressures. These insights contribute to understanding the nuanced dynamics of prey species' responses to diverse predation scenarios.","[Tobajas, Jorge] Univ Cordoba, Dept Bot Ecol & Fisiol Vegetal, Campus Rabanales, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain; [Ferreira, C.

At present, there are few reports on the establishment of rabbits' gut microbiota and its relationship with the host. To clarify the colonization of rabbits' gut microbiota, the changes in species during development, and the relationship between gut microbiota and rabbits' growth and development, this study determined the 16s rRNA of gut microbiota in rabbits of different age groups and preliminarily explored the changes in the types of gut microbiota during the colonization process. Six amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that significantly affect body weight were obtained. The research results provide a firm theoretical basis for maintaining gut health and constructing new methods for rabbit breeding. This study used feces from 0-day-old (36 rabbits), 10-day-old (119 rabbits), and 60-day-old (119 rabbits) offspring rabbits and their corresponding female rabbits (36 rabbits) as experimental materials. Using 16s rRNA sequencing, the study analyzed the types and changes of gut microbiota in rabbits at different growth and development stages, as well as the correlation between gut microbiota composition and the weight of 60-day-old rabbits. All experimental rabbits were placed in the same rabbit shed. Juvenile rabbits were fed solid feed at 18 days of age and weaned at 35 days of age. In addition to identifying the dominant bacterial phyla of gut microbiota in rabbits at different age stages, it was found that the abundance of Clostridium tertium and Clostridium paraputrificum in all suckling rabbits (10-day-old) was significantly higher than that in rabbits fed with whole feed (60-day-old) (p < 0.05), while the abundance of Gram-negative bacterium cTPY13 was significantly lower (p < 0.05). In addition, Fast Expected Maximum Microbial Source Tracing (FEAST) analysis showed that the contribution of female rabbits' gut microbiota to the colonization of offspring rabbits' gut microbiota was significantly higher than that of unrelated rabbits' gut microbiota (p < 0.05). The contribution of female rabbits' gut microbiota to the colonization of gut microbiota in 0-day-old rabbits was significantly higher than that to the colonization of gut microbiota in the 10- and 60-day-old rabbits (p < 0.05). Finally, the correlation between gut microbiota composition and body weight of 60-day-old rabbits was analyzed based on a mixed linear model, and six ASVs significantly affecting body weight were screened. The above results provide important theoretical and practical guidance for maintaining gut health, improving growth and development performance, and feeding formulation in rabbits.","[Fu, Chong; Ma, Yue; Xia, Siqi; Shao, Jiahao; Tang, Tao] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Sun, Wenqiang; Jia, Xianbo; Wang, Jie; Lai, Songjia] Sichuan Agr Univ, Farm Anim Genet Resources Explorat & Innovat, Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China",Sichuan Agricultural University; Sichuan Agricultural University,"Lai, SJ (corresponding author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Farm Anim Genet Resources Explorat & Innovat, Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.",laisj5794@163.com,,"Wang, Jie/0000-0002-1399-7079; Jia, Xian-Bo/0000-0002-6885-4104",Sichuan Provincial Department of Science and Technology [2023NS-FSC0235]; Key research and development project of Sichuan Province [2021YFYZ0033]; Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs [CARS-43-A-2],Sichuan Provincial Department of Science and Technology; Key research and development project of Sichuan Province; Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs(Gida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi),"This study was funded by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Science and Technology project The Influence of Gut Microorganisms on the Heterosis of Rabbit Growth Traits (2023NS-FSC0235), the key research and development project of Sichuan Province, Innovation of High Quality and Characteristic Rabbit Breeding Materials and Methods and New Variety Selection (2021YFYZ0033), and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs project National Rabbit Industry Technology System Meat Rabbit Variety Improvement Post (CARS-43-A-2).",,40,3,3,1,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,JUN,2024,14.0,12.0,,,,,,,1741,10.3390/ani14121741,0,,,13,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,WL1H5,38929360.0,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-15,WOS:001254927700001,0,rabbits

This study aimed to examine how past and current experiences, reasons for acquiring rabbits, and methods of knowledge acquisition impact the lifestyle and health of pet rabbits in households. Among 306 rabbit owners surveyed, 25% had previous experience with rabbits, and 54% had owned rabbits for over 3 years. While 61% sought veterinary care upon acquiring rabbits, only 47% scheduled regular check-ups, and 38% consulted a veterinarian when health changes were noticed. Sixty-nine percent of rabbits were primarily fed hay, and just 23% were provided companionship with other rabbits. Reasons for acquiring rabbits included gifts (17%) and seeking companionship (43%). Only 18% of respondents obtained information about rabbit care from veterinarians. These factors significantly influenced owners' assessments of rabbit lifestyle (p < 0.001), with current experience impacting health management (p < 0.01).

As a crucial economic animal, rabbit has been successfully bred into wool-use, meat-use and fur-use breeds. Hair length is one of the most economically important traits affecting profitability in wool rabbits. In this study, to identify selection signatures with the long-hair trait, whole-genomic resequencing of long-haired rabbits (Angora rabbits) and short-haired rabbits (Rex and New Zealand rabbits) was performed.ResultsBy genome-wide selective sweeping analysis based on population comparison, we identified a total of 5.85 Mb regions (containing 174 candidate genes) with strong selection signals. Six of these genes (Dusp1, Ihh, Fam134a, Map3k1, Spata16, and Fgf5) were enriched in the MAPK signalling and Hedgehog signalling pathways, both of which are closely associated with hair growth regulation. Among these genes, Fgf5 encodes the FGF5 protein, which is a well-established regulator of hair growth. There was a nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution (T19234C) in the Fgf5 gene. At this locus, the C allele was present in all of the tested Angora rabbits, while the T allele was dominant in New Zealand and Rex rabbits. We further confirmed that the C allele was conserved in Angora rabbits by screening an additional 135 rabbits. Moreover, the results of functional predictions and co-immunoprecipitation revealed that the T19234C mutation impaired the binding capacity of FGF5 to its receptor FGFR1.ConclusionsWe discovered that the homozygous missense mutation T19234C within Fgf5 might contribute to the long-hair trait of Angora rabbits by reducing its receptor binding capacity. This finding will provide new insights into the genetic basis underlying the genetic improvement of Angora rabbits and benefit the improvement of rabbit breeding in the future.","[Fatima, Nazira; Jia, Linying; Liu, Baoning; Li, Lu; Bai, Liang; Wang, Weirong; Zhao, Sihai; Wang, Rong; Liu, Enqi] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Lab Anim Sci, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Fatima, Nazira; Jia, Linying; Liu, Baoning; Li, Lu; Bai, Liang; Wang, Weirong; Zhao, Sihai; Wang, Rong; Liu, Enqi] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Lab Anim Ctr, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Wang, R; Liu, EQ (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Dept Lab Anim Sci, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Wang, R; Liu, EQ (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Lab Anim Ctr, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",rongw1986@mail.xjtu.edu.cn; liuenqi@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,"Zhao, Sihai/0000-0002-5845-6639","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M562425] Funding Source: Medline; National Natural Science Foundation of China [82170471] Funding Source: Medline; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province [2020PT-001, 2023-CX-PT-01, 2020PT-001, 2023-CX-PT-01] Funding Source: Medline",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province),,,55,16,19,2,18,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2164,,,BMC GENOMICS,BMC Genomics,JUN 2,2023,24.0,1.0,,,,,,,298,10.1186/s12864-023-09405-2,0,,,13,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,H8UQ4,37268908.0,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-15,WOS:000998650700001,0,rabbits

Prospective study. We injured the tracheal walls of 28 New Zealand white rabbits using four different methods. Experimental group: Group A (n = 7, mild injury of tracheal mucosa by ordinary brush under bronchoscopy); Group B (n = 7, severe injury of tracheal mucosa by nylon brush under tracheotomy); Group C (n = 7, tracheal cartilage was injured by vascular clamp after tracheotomy); Group D (n = 7, the tracheal cartilage was injured with vascular forceps and the tracheal mucosa was injured with a nylon brush after tracheotomy). Bronchoscopy was performed on each experimental rabbit at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after operation. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and endobronchial optical coherence tomography (EB-OCT) were performed at 4 weeks, and the rabbits were sacrificed after the examination. Their gross and histological findings were comparatively determined whether the experimental rabbit stenosis was established. No airway stenosis was observed in group A. In group B, 28.57% of experimental rabbits developed tracheal stenosis (granulation tissue proliferation was observed in rabbits No. 2 and No. 6 at 1, 2 and 3 weeks after operation, and the tracheal scar contracture was observed in No.6 rabbit at 4 weeks after operation). Fourteen rabbits in group C and group D had tracheal stenosis caused by granulation tissue proliferation at 1, 2 and 3 weeks after operation. At the fourth week after operation, 71.43% of experimental rabbits had tracheal stenosis due to granulation tissue hyperplasia, 7.14% of experimental rabbits had tracheal stenosis due to scar contracture and granulation hyperplasia, and 21.43% of experimental rabbits had tracheal stenosis due to scar contracture. EB-OCT scan showed that the cartilage layer with low signal reflection band was discontinuous. The injury of cartilage is the key factor of benign airway stenosis. Acute injury of airway mucosa alone is unlikely to cause airway stenosis, but combined with cartilage injury may aggravate airway stenosis. EB-OCT can clearly identify the airway layers of rabbits, which is helpful to evaluate the damage of tracheal cartilage and mucosa. The diagnostic potential of this technique makes EB-OCT a promising approach for the study and monitoring of airway diseases.","[Yang, Zhen yu; Zeng, Da xiong; Jiang, Jun hong] Soochow Univ, Dushu Lake Hosp, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Suzhou 215125, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jie; Liu, Yue hong; Liu, Zi yi; Wang, Chang guo; Zeng, Da xiong; Jiang, Jun hong] Soochow Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Soochow University - China; Soochow University - China,"Jiang, JH (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Dushu Lake Hosp, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Suzhou 215125, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Jiang, JH (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jiangjunhong1969@suda.edu.cn,"Liu, ziyi/HHM-8313-2022",,Jiangsu social development science and technology R&D project in 2016 [BE2016672]; Suzhou Science and Technology Project [2021026],Jiangsu social development science and technology R&D project in 2016; Suzhou Science and Technology Project,"Jiangsu social development science and technology R&D project in 2016 (BE2016672), Suzhou Science and Technology Project (SKY 2021026)",,31,13,15,1,4,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,FEB 23,2023,13.0,1.0,,,,,,,3144,10.1038/s41598-023-29483-2,0,,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,G3QV8,36823432.0,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-15,WOS:000988352100069,0,rabbits

Rabbits were allotted into four groups: G1 rabbits were fed the basal diet (control), G2 rabbits received Enterococcus faecium (EF) and Clostridium butyricum (CB) complexes (1 x 10(8) and 2.5 x 10(6) cfu/kg diet, respectively), G3 rabbits were given CB (2.5 x 10(6) cfu/kg diet) and yeast complexes (1 g/kg diet), and G4 rabbits received EF (2 x 10(8) cfu/kg diet) and yeast (1 g/kg diet). G2 rabbits exhibited the highest performances in terms of enhanced body weight and weight gain, protein efficiency ratio and feed conversion ratio (P < 0.05). Serum total protein, globulin, immunoglobulin M, and high-density lipoprotein concentrations were higher in probiotic-fed rabbits than those in controls. Additionally, lipid profile parameters were significantly reduced in the probiotic-fed rabbits, with the lowest concentrations measured in G4 rabbits (P < 0.05). Rabbits given EF and CB had the highest total volatile fatty acid (VFA) and propionic acid levels and the lowest ammonia concentrations. Increased villi length and muscular layer thickness and reduced crypt depth were observed in rabbits receiving EF and CB compared with the values obtained in controls (P < 0.05). In summary, supplementing fattening rabbit diets with EF and CB, as a novel formulation, might be a promising and easy method to enhance growth performance under hot climate conditions by improving the feed utilization, immune response, serum lipid profile, cecal VFA production, and duodenal morphology.","[Alagawany, Mahmoud; Bassiony, Samar S.

Factors, such as human-directed aggression and friendliness, are important from the aspect of animal welfare and owner satisfaction. In an online questionnaire for Hungarian pet rabbit owners (N = 1039 entries), we targeted the interactions between rabbits and their owners as well as interactions with strangers. The sex, reproductive status, breed, origin, keeping conditions of the rabbit, diet, and the owners' knowledge about sensitive period treatment, were asked in the questionnaire. Principal Component Analysis yielded three behavioral dimensions (explaining the 63.5% of total variance) - which, based on the encompassed items, were named 'Amicable', 'Aggression towards strangers' and 'Aggression towards the owner'. In the next step we looked for significant associations between the three behavioral components and the aforementioned fixed factors. We found that 'Amicable' had higher scores in the case of male rabbits (vs. females, P < 0.001), intact rabbits (vs. spayed/neutered, P < 0.05), and dwarf pet rabbit breeds (vs. large traditional meat rabbits, P < 0.001). Low 'Amicable' scores were given to rabbits that were adopted from shelters (P < 0.01), and also to those that were never let out from their cages/pens (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the owners who knew about the importance of the early socialization period, had the most 'Amicable' rabbits (P < 0.05). Finally, individually kept rabbits and those that received the longest time of maternal care (kept with the mother even after weaning), were considered as more 'Amicable' than those rabbits that had other rabbit companions (P < 0.05); or were separated from their mother before normal weaning time (P < 0.05). We found similarly detailed results regarding the associations between the independent variables and the two 'Aggression' components. We also found more unique associations, for example between the type of food and aggressiveness; rabbits fed with muesli-type feed reportedly behaved more aggressively with humans (P < 0.05) than those that were fed mainly pellets with additional hay. Understandably, there are also limitations as we could not establish causality from these results and also the distribution of the subjects among the various categories was sometimes far from balanced, which may lessen the representativity of the results in particular cases.","[Dobos, Petra; Kulik, Laura Nikolett; Pongracz, Peter] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Ethol, ELTE, Budapest, Hungary; [Pongracz, Peter] ELTE, Dept Ethol, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary",Eotvos Lorand University; Eotvos Lorand University,"Pongrácz, P (corresponding author), ELTE, Dept Ethol, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",peter.pongracz@ttk.elte.hu,"Pongracz, Peter/C-9811-2013; Dobos, Petra/OJU-7959-2025",,"Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH) [K143077]","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH)(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary)","Petra Dobos and Pe ' ter Pongr ' acz were supported by the Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH, Grant #K143077) .

However, little is known about the rate at which this evolutionary change occurred. We collated data from challenge trials that estimated rabbit resistance to myxomatosis in Australia and expressed resistance on a continuous scale, enabling trends in its development to be assessed over 45 years up to 1995. Resistance initially increased rapidly, followed by a plateau lasting ten years, before a second rapid increase occurred associated with the introduction of European rabbit fleas as myxoma virus vectors. By contrast, in the United Kingdom, where rabbit flea vectors were already present when the myxoma virus initially spread, resistance developed more slowly. No estimates of rabbit resistance to myxomatosis have been made for almost 30 years, despite other highly lethal rabbit pathogens becoming established worldwide. Continued testing of wild-caught rabbits in Australia to determine current levels of resistance to myxomatosis is recommended to assess its current effectiveness for managing pest rabbits.

Ear disease may be common in rabbits, but difficult to recognise, and lop-ears have previously been indicated as a risk factor for ear disease. We aimed to better understand the range of ear conditions in pet rabbits, signalment risk factors, and impacts on welfare and behaviour. Through an online questionnaire, we investigated owner-reported signalment, veterinary diagnosis of ear conditions, impaired hearing, and ear pain for UK pet rabbits. Relationships between ear condition measures and ear conformation, quality of life, and behaviour were analysed using logistic regression. Of 551 valid responses, 28.5% of rabbits reportedly had experienced ear conditions; 21.2% diagnosed or mentioned by vets, with otitis and excess cerumen most common. Approximately 25% of lop-eared rabbits had ear conditions indicated by a vet versus 10% of erect-eared rabbits. Lop-eared, half-lop, and older rabbits were most at risk (P<0.050). Rabbits reported as showing ear pain responses had reduced owner-reported quality of life compared with other rabbits (P<0.050). Rabbits with ear problems were less likely to be responsive to relevant sounds, and performed binky behaviour (joy jumps) less frequently, than rabbits without such issues. Understanding prevalence and risk factors for ear conditions is critical to improving welfare standards across this widely owned pet species. The findings suggest that improved recognition and treatment of ear conditions, and avoiding breeding from rabbits with early signs, or a family history, of ear disease are necessary to help combat this animal welfare issue.","[Chivers, Benedict D.

Poultry and rabbit production has recently experienced many challenges, including climate change, disease spread, and antibiotic misuse. Bee products have emerged as promising natural alternatives to antibiotics due to their nutritional and therapeutic properties. This review aims to present an overview of the possible advantages of using different bee products, separately or combined, in poultry and rabbit farms. The results indicate that bee products can positively affect poultry and rabbit's physiological traits, production, reproduction, health/immunity, and product quality. Therefore, bee products have great potential as a safe and effective addition to poultry and rabbit production.Abstract Poultry and rabbit production are important and rapidly growing agricultural subsectors, particularly in several developing countries. To ensure the sustainability of poultry and rabbit production, realistic poultry and rabbit farming practices must be improved. Apitherapy is a traditional alternative medicine that involves the prevention and treatment of some diseases with several bee products including propolis, royal jelly, pollen, and venom. More feeding investigations on the numerous benefits of bee products for poultry and rabbits are crucial to be addressed. Poultry and rabbit production has recently experienced numerous challenges, including climate change, disease spread, and antibiotic misuse. Improving animal welfare, health, and production is a top priority for all livestock farms, as is supplying consumers with safe and healthy products. Therefore, this review aims to collect and investigate recent relevant literature on the use of bee products, as feed additives, drinking water supplements, and injections, for poultry and rabbits to improve animal health and production. From the current findings, bee products can improve the growth and immunological performance of small-livestock animals, such as poultry and rabbits, by activating digestive enzymes, maintaining microbial balance, and promoting vitamin synthesis. Therefore, bee products could be a promising natural alternative to growth promoters, reproductive stimulants, and immunological enhancers in poultry and rabbit farms to provide safe and healthy products for humans.","[Abd El-Aziz, Ayman; Abo Ghanima, Mahmoud] Damanhour Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Anim Husb & Anim Wealth Dev, Damanhour 22511, Egypt; [Mota-Rojas, Daniel] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana UAM, Neurophysiol Pain Behav & Assessment Welf Domest A, DPAA, Xochimilco Campus, Mexico City 04960, Mexico; [Sherasiya, Anjum] Vet World, Wankaner 363621, Gujarat, India; [Ciani, Francesca] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Vet Med & Anim Prod, I-80138 Naples, Italy; [El-Sabrout, Karim] Alexandria Univ, Fac Agr, Poultry Prod Dept, Alexandria 21545, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Damanhour University; Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico; University of Naples Federico II; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Alexandria University,"El-Sabrout, K (corresponding author), Alexandria Univ, Fac Agr, Poultry Prod Dept, Alexandria 21545, Egypt.",sadaka@vetmed.dmu.edu.eg; kareem.badr@alexu.edu.eg,"Abd El-Aziz, Ayman/AAG-5126-2019; Mota-Rojas, Daniel/AAY-5755-2021; Ciani, Francesca/B-8202-2015; El-Sabrout, Karim/M-5521-2018; Ghanima, Mahmoud/AAU-8401-2020; Sherasiya, Anjum/JXL-5512-2024","Abo ghanima, Mahmoud/0000-0002-1788-5082; Mota-Rojas, Daniel/0000-0003-0562-0367; Sherasiya, Anjum/0000-0002-1598-1820; Abd El-Aziz, Ayman/0000-0002-8306-0011; El-Sabrout, Karim/0000-0003-2762-2363;",,,,,101,14,16,2,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,NOV,2023,13.0,22.0,,,,,,,3517,10.3390/ani13223517,0,,,12,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,Y8RZ5,38003135.0,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-15,WOS:001107892100001,0,rabbits

In this study, 96 New Zealand White rabbits (male and female ratio 1:1) were used, and they were five weeks old. The rabbits were at random allocated into four experimental groups (n = 24 each) comprising 12 replicates, each with two rabbits. The 1st group acted as the control and received feed without additional supplements. The 2nd group received 0.30% HM, the 3rd group received 0.50% HM, and the 4th group received 0.70% HM. As the concentration of the herbal mixture extract was raised, the inhibitory zones grew significantly. The addition of HM to rabbit diets at a 0.5% concentration significantly increased body weight and weight gain compared to the control diet and other treatments. The apparent digestibility coefficient of ether extracts and the rabbits' capacity to absorb lipids significantly increased with increasing HM levels up to 0.7%. In addition, the HM increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreased triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the blood. Interestingly, when rabbits were fed varying amounts of HM, all types of bacteria significantly declined, yet helpful lactic acid bacteria increased. In conclusion, HM supplementation improved rabbit growth, blood parameters, and gut microbial balance, with a 0.5% level yielding the best results, indicating that HM has significant potential as a novel feed supplement for growing rabbits.","[Abou-Kassem, Diaa E.; Mahrose, Khalid M.; Abd El-Hack, Mohamed E.] Zagazig Univ, Fac Technol & Dev, Anim & Poultry Prod Dept, Zagazig 44519, Egypt; [Ashour, Elwy A.] Zagazig Univ, Fac Agr, Poultry Dept, Zagazig 44511, Egypt; [Youssef, Islam M.] Agr Res Ctr, Anim Prod Res Inst, Dokki 12618, Giza, Egypt; [Tellez-Isaias, Guillermo] Univ Arkansas, Dept Poultry Sci, Div Agr, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Swelum, Ayman A.] King Saud Univ, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Dept Anim Prod, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Zagazig University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Zagazig University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Agricultural Research Center - Egypt; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; King Saud University,"Abd El-Hack, ME (corresponding author), Zagazig Univ, Fac Technol & Dev, Anim & Poultry Prod Dept, Zagazig 44519, Egypt.;Swelum, AA (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Dept Anim Prod, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.",aswelum@ksu.edu.sa; dr.mohamed.e.abdalhaq@gmail.com,"Abd El-Hack, Mohamed/H-9342-2019; Abou-Kassem, Diaa/AAH-7440-2021; Mahrose, Khalid/F-9212-2011; Swelum, Ayman/S-1039-2017; Swelum, Ayman Abdel-Aziz/S-1039-2017","Abd El-Hack, Mohamed/0000-0002-2831-8534; Mahrose, Khalid/0000-0002-9917-5921; Swelum, Ayman Abdel-Aziz/0000-0003-3247-5898","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSPD2025R971]","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","The authors extend their appreciation to the Researchers supporting Project number (RSPD2025R971), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for funding this research.",,80,9,9,3,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0049-4747,1573-7438,,TROP ANIM HEALTH PRO,Trop.

Thus, using a friendly alternative is an appropriate way to protect rabbits from pathogens while also enhancing their performance and welfare. Lysozyme, an enzyme derived from avian egg white, aids in nutrient digestion and absorption and provides protection against bacterial diseases while lowering pollutants' excretion, such as ammonia. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of lysozyme supplementation in rabbits' diets on growth performance, caecal fermentation, bacteria population, and blood constituents. The results demonstrated an improvement in rabbit performance, caecal fermentation, blood lipid profile, and antioxidant status due to an increase in beneficial bacteria in lysozyme-treated rabbits. Therefore, supplementing the rabbit diet with lysozyme up to 150 mg/kg is recommended. The effects of exogenous lysozyme supplementation (LYZ) on growth performance, caecal fermentation and microbiota, and blood characteristics were investigated in growing rabbits. A total of 420 growing male V-Line rabbits (30 d old; weighing 528 +/- 16 g) were randomly divided into four groups of 105 rabbits each, and monitored for 42 days. Experimental groups included a control group (LYZ0) fed a basal diet without LYZ supplementation, and three treated groups fed the same basal diet supplemented with LYZ at 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg diet, respectively. The results showed a quadratic improvement in the final body weight, daily growth rate, FCR, and digestibility of DM, while the digestibility of OM, CP, EE, NDF, and ADF improved linearly when LYZ supplementation was increased. The dressing percentage increased quadratically when LYZ levels were increased in the rabbit diets. In rabbits fed LYZ diets, L. acidophilus counts increased linearly (p < 0.05) and L. cellobiosus, and Enterococcus sp. counts increased quadratically, whereas E. coli counts decreased. In the LYZ-supplemented groups, the caecal pH value and NH3-N concentration declined quadratically, whereas total VFA, acetic, and butyric acids increased. Total lipids decreased linearly, whilst triglycerides and cholesterol decreased quadratically with LYZ supplementation. Total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, and catalase increased quadratically, while malondialdehyde decreased linearly in the LYZ-supplemented groups. In conclusion, exogenous lysozyme administration improved rabbit growth performance and antioxidant status while lowering the blood lipid profile, altering the bacterial population, and regulating caecal fermentation. Therefore, LYZ up to 150 mg/kg can be used as a potential supplement in rabbit feed.","[Abu Hafsa, Salma H.] City Sci Res & Technol Applicat, Livestock Res Dept, Arid Lands Cultivat Res Inst, Alexandria 21934, Egypt; [Mahmoud, Amr E.

Environmental enrichment (EE) could reduce stress in farm animals; however, limited information is available on the microbial community composition in rabbits raised with or without EE. This study aimed to identify EE influences on the behavior, serum hormonal levels, and cecal microbiota of rabbits. Two hundred Rex rabbits were segregated randomly within four cohorts (n = 50); reared for 76 d within standardized enclosures (non enriched) or within cages containing a willow-stick (WS), rubber-duck (RD), or a can of beans (CB). The rabbits' ingestive, rest, locomotion, exploratory, grooming, and abnormal behavior were observed. The serum hormone levels for rabbits were measured, and cecal specimens were sequencedfrom the V3-V4 region using 16S rRNA amplicons. Environmental enrichment increased feeding and drinking time, promoted exploratory behavior, and reduced abnormal behavior in rabbits. Insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1) levels of the enriched cohorts were elevated in comparison to the control cohort. Serum cortisol level for CB cohort was markedly reduced in comparison to the control cohort (p < 0.05), while dopamine levels for CB cohort peaked. Further, we found that EE mainly affected the dominant microbiota. Several families, such as Erysipelotrichaceae, Tannerellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Burkholderiaceae, and Prevotellaceae were markedly reduced within the CB cohort. Bacteria such as Alloprevotella, Bifidobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, Parabacteroides, and Erysipelatoclostridium were identified as having negative associations with the presence of serum cortisol. EE influenced rabbit behavior and serum hormonal levels, and CB enrichment was the most suitable for rabbits. Further, cecal microbiota composition and diversity were affected by CB enrichment. These findings suggested that CB could be considered for use in rabbit husbandry.","[Feng, Yang; Liang, Xue; Wang, Xiaofeng; Gao, Guoyan; Gun, Shuangbao] Gansu Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Fan, Huimei] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Gansu Agricultural University; Sichuan Agricultural University,"Gun, SB (corresponding author), Gansu Agr Univ, Coll Anim Sci & Technol, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.",gunsb@gsau.edu.cn,,,Youth Science and Technology Fund [20JR10RA547]; Discipline Construction Fund Project of Gansu Agricultural University [GAU-XKJS-2018-053],Youth Science and Technology Fund; Discipline Construction Fund Project of Gansu Agricultural University,"This work was funded by the Youth Science and Technology Fund (20JR10RA547) and Discipline Construction Fund Project of Gansu Agricultural University (GAU-XKJS-2018-053).

Among the main factors influencing the characteristics of rabbit meat proteins to appertain the breed, genotype, carcass part and age. Conventional production of rabbit meat in many European countries is mainly ensured by intensive production systems, when commercial meat-type albinotic rabbit crossbreds are used. However, spotted and solidly coloured lines of meat rabbit breeds have begun to be used in rabbit breeding schemes as some consumers have begun to negatively perceive meat from albinotic coloured rabbits. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of the sire genotype, sex and carcass part on the composition of meats of rabbits fattened under conditions where no synthetic drugs were used. Crossbreeding of Mecklenburger Schecke sires with a commercial dam line of HYLA rabbits resulted in a worse nutritional quality of meat proteins in progeny. These findings point to a possible risk of alterations in the nutritional quality of meat proteins when using different rabbit sire genotypes than those originally intended for the specific commercial crossbreeding scheme. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of the sire genotype, sex and carcass part on the composition of the meat of rabbits, which were fattened under conditions where no synthetic drugs were used. As for carcass parts, the higher content of both total amino acids (AA) and all essential AA (EAA) monitored was found in the Longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscle as compared to hind leg meat (p < 0.001). Significant effects of the rabbit sire genotype and the genotype x sex interaction on proportions of some AA in meat were found (p < 0.001). Crossbreeding of the Mecklenburger Schecke (MS) sires with a commercial dam line of HYLA rabbits resulted in a lower proportion of the total AA and all EAA monitored in meats of MS sired males as compared to MS sired females and HYLA rabbits (p < 0.05). The sex-related effect on AA profile was not so noticeable in final commercial crossbreds of HYLA rabbits when compared to MS sired progeny. These findings point to a possible risk of alterations in the nutritional quality of meat proteins when using different rabbit sire genotypes than those originally intended for the specific commercial crossbreeding scheme. However, on the contrary, higher contents of magnesium (p < 0.05), manganese (p < 0.001) and zinc (p < 0.05) were found in meats of MS sired progeny as compared to HYLA rabbits.","[Gal, Robert] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Technol, Dept Food Technol, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic; [Zapletal, David; Jakesova, Petra; Strakova, Eva] Univ Vet Sci Brno, Fac Vet Hyg & Ecol, Dept Anim Breeding Anim Nutr & Biochem, Brno 61242, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin; University of Veterinary Sciences Brno,"Zapletal, D (corresponding author), Univ Vet Sci Brno, Fac Vet Hyg & Ecol, Dept Anim Breeding Anim Nutr & Biochem, Brno 61242, Czech Republic.",gal@ft.utb.cz; zapletald@vfu.cz; p.humpolcova@seznam.cz; strakovae@vfu.cz,"; Zapletal, David/ABC-2575-2020","Gál, Robert/0000-0001-6110-7918;",Internal Grant Agency of the University of Veterinary Sciences Brno [202/2019/FVHE],Internal Grant Agency of the University of Veterinary Sciences Brno,"Project financially supported by the Internal Grant Agency of the University of Veterinary Sciences Brno, Project No. 202/2019/FVHE.",,65,14,16,0,30,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,,,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,JUN,2022,12.0,12.0,,,,,,,1537,10.3390/ani12121537,0,,,15,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,2N2ZO,35739873.0,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2025-12-15,WOS:000818253900001,0,rabbits

Recently, probiotics have been provided as direct microbial feed supplements, which are considered the ideal antibiotic substitutes during pathogenic infections with an emphasis on promoting rabbits' growth and modulating their immune functions. Therefore, our experiment was carried out to explore the efficacy of multi-strain probiotics (MSP) on rabbits' growth, molecular aspects, such as nutrients transporters, cytokines, and intestinal integrity, and effectiveness against Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) infection. Altogether, our findings proposed the beneficial consequences of MSP on rabbits' growth, gut health, and immunity. After post-experimental infection of rabbits with L. monocytogenes, administration of MSP during the whole rearing period greatly reduced the detrimental impact of infection and consequently renovated efficient rabbits' production. Multi-strain probiotics (MSP) are considered innovative antibiotics' substitutes supporting superior gut health and immunity of farmed rabbits. The promising roles of MSP on performance, intestinal immunity, integrity and transporters, and resistance against Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) were evaluated. In the feeding trial, 220 rabbits were fed a control diet or diet supplemented with three MSP graded levels. At 60 days of age, rabbits were experimentally infected with L. monocytogenes and the positive control, enrofloxacin, prophylactic MSP (MSPP), and prophylactic and therapeutic MSP (MSPTT) groups were included. During the growing period, MSP at the level of 1 x 10(8) CFU/kg diet (MSPIII) promoted the rabbits' growth, upregulated the nutrient transporters and tight-junction-related genes, and modified cytokines expression. Supplementing MSPTT for L. monocytogenes experimentally-infected rabbits restored the impaired growth and intestinal barriers, reduced clinical signs of severity and mortalities, and attenuated the excessive inflammatory reactions. Notably, enrofloxacin decreased L. monocytogenes and beneficial microbial loads; unlike MSPTT, which decreased pathogenic bacterial loads and sustained the beneficial ones. Histopathological changes were greatly reduced in MSPTT, confirming its promising role in restricting L. monocytogenes translocation to different organs.

In this study, semi-structured interviews were used to explore public perceptions of companion rabbit ownership and accommodation requirements. Thematic analysis revealed that participant views about keeping rabbits as companion animals varied, including their perceptions of the care they require. Seventy-one percent of the participants with previous rabbit ownership experience were unlikely to consider rabbit ownership again, mainly due to the realities of rabbit care. Tradition and the lack of visibility of good practice were cited as key influences behind perceptions of appropriate rabbit accommodation. Participants lacked awareness of the minimum space required for adequate rabbit accommodation within the Good Practice Code for the Welfare of Rabbits. Acquisition sources were considered an important avenue for advice about appropriate rabbit accommodation provision. Owner ability to suitably provide for rabbit needs was highlighted as a significant issue. Ultimately with conflict between what society can provide and rabbit welfare needs, the future of rabbits as companion animals in the United Kingdom is uncertain.","[Powdrill-Wells, Natalie; Ryan, Samantha; Stoneman, Kattie; Cooke, Fiona] Woodgreen Pets Char, Policy & Impact, London Rd, Godmanchester PE29 2NH, England",,"Powdrill-Wells, N (corresponding author), Woodgreen Pets Char, Policy & Impact, London Rd, Godmanchester PE29 2NH, England.",Natalie.wells@woodgreen.org.uk,,,Woodgreen Pets Charity,Woodgreen Pets Charity,The work was funded by Woodgreen Pets Charity in that the authors were all employed by Woodgreen.,,33,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1088-8705,1532-7604,,J APPL ANIM WELF SCI,J.

This investigation evaluates an age differential response to bevacizumab in older populations of rabbits using multimodal high resolution molecular imaging. Young (4 months old) and life span (14 months old) rabbits were given subretinal injections of Matrigel and VEGF to produce CNV. All CNV rabbit models were then treated with a bevacizumab intravitreal injection. Rabbits were then monitored longitudinally using photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), op-tical coherence tomography (OCT), color photography, and fluorescence imaging. Chain-like gold nanoparticle clusters (CGNP) conjugated with tripeptide arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) was injected intravenously for molecular imaging. Robust CNV developed in both young and old rabbits. After intravitreal bevacizumab in-jection, fluorescence signals were markedly decreased 90.13% in the young group. In contrast, old rabbit CNV area decreased by only 10.56% post-bevacizumab treatment. OCT images confirmed a rapid decrease of CNV in the young group. CGNPs demonstrated high PAM signal in old rabbits and minimal PAM signal in young rabbits after bevacizumab, indicating CNV regression. There is a significant difference in response to intravitreal bev-acizumab treatment between young and old rabbits with CNV which can be monitored with multimodal mo-lecular imaging. Old rabbits demonstrate significant persistent disease activity. This represents the first large eye model of persistent disease activity of CNV and could serve as the foundation for future investigations into the mechanism of persistent disease activity and the development of novel therapies.","[Nguyen, Van Phuc; Henry, Jessica; Zhe, Josh; Kieu, Quynh; Paulus, Yannis M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Wang, Xueding; Paulus, Yannis M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Biomed Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Fu, Yingbin] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Houston, TX 76706 USA; [Qian, Wei] IMRA Amer Inc, 1044 Woodridge Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Paulus, Yannis M.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Dept Biomed Engn, 1000 Wall St, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Baylor College of Medicine; IMRA America, Inc.; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan","Paulus, YM (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Dept Biomed Engn, 1000 Wall St, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA.",vanphucn@med.umich.edu; jeshenry@umich.edu; joshzhe@umich.edu; kieuquyn@msu.edu; wqian@imra.com; Yingbin.Fu@bcm.edu; xdwang@umich.edu; ypaulus@med.umich.edu,,"Paulus, Yannis/0000-0002-0615-628X; Fu, Yingbin/0000-0001-5408-1350","National Eye Institute [P30 EY007003, 1K08EY027458, 1R41EY031219, 1R01EY033000, 1R01EY029489]; Fight for Sight-International Retinal Research Foundation [FFSGIA16002]; Alcon Research Institute Young Investigator Grant (YMP); National Eye Institute [P30EY007003, R01EY033000, K08EY027458, R01EY029489] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)); Fight for Sight-International Retinal Research Foundation; Alcon Research Institute Young Investigator Grant (YMP); National Eye Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI)),"This report was sponsored by grants from the National Eye Institute with grant number 1K08EY027458 (YMP) , 1R41EY031219 (YMP) , 1R01EY033000 (YMP) , 1R01EY029489 (YMP and XW) , Fight for Sight-International Retinal Research Foundation grant number FFSGIA16002 (YMP) , and Alcon Research Institute Young Investigator Grant (YMP) .

Fluralaner, an isoxazoline class of oral ectoparasiticide, is considered as a very potent acaricide. The present study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of oral fluralaner in pet rabbits with severe spontaneous Sarcoptes scabiei infestation. A total of eight un-neutered pet rabbits, tested positive for S. scabiei by microscopy of skin scrapings, were enrolled. Seven rabbits had severe clinical infestation (score 5), while remaining one rabbit had moderate disease clinical signs (score <3). A single oral dose equivalent to 25 mg/kg of fluralaner was administered to each rabbit. On day 14 post-therapy, marked improvements in the skin lesions were observed; severely infested rabbits had a clinical score of 3, while the moderately infested rabbit had a score of 1. However, none of the rabbits tested negative for S. scabiei. On day 30 post-therapy, complete clinical recovery was recorded in all rabbits (Score 0), but, a complete parasitological clearance was not recorded except to the moderately infested rabbit. All rabbits were tested negative for S. scabiei on day 45 post-therapy. Therefore, a single oral dose of fluralaner at a 25 mg/kg was found to be effective in the treatment of severe sarcoptic mange in pet rabbits and no additional topical or systemic medications were needed. Further studies in a larger number of individuals with a bigger spectrum of disease severities (i.e. more moderate/mild) are needed to comprehensively document the safety and efficacy of this drug in mangy rabbits.","[Singh, Shanker K.; Kumari, Sanju; Khushboo, Richa; Jaiswal, Manu] UP Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Pashu Chikitsa Vig, Coll Vet Sci & Anim Husb, Dept Vet Med, Mathura 281001, UP, India; [Jaiswal, Amit K.; Gaur, Ruchi Singh] UP Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Pashu Chikitsa Vig, Coll Vet Sci & Anim Husb, Dept Vet Parasitol, Mathura 281001, UP, India; [Sharma, Prabha] UP Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Pashu Chikitsa Vig, Coll Vet Sci & Anim Husb, Dept Vet Surg & Radiol, Mathura 281001, UP, India",U.P.

The tools used to study animal movement have evolved over the past decades, allowing for data collection from a variety of species, including those living in remote environments. Satellite-linked radio and GPS collars have been used to study polar bear (Ursus maritimus) ecology and movements throughout the circumpolar Arctic for over 50 years. However, due to morphology and growth constraints, only adult female polar bears can be reliably collared. Collars have proven to be safe, but there has been opposition to their use, resulting in a deficiency in data across much of the species' range. To bolster knowledge of movement characteristics and behaviours for polar bears other than adult females, while also providing an alternative to collars, we tested the use of fur- and ear-mounted telemetry tags that can be affixed to polar bears of any sex and age. We tested three fur tag designs (SeaTrkr, tribrush and pentagon tags), which we affixed to 15 adult and 1 subadult male polar bears along the coast of Hudson Bay during August-September 2021-2022. Fur tags were compared with ear tags deployed on 42 subadult and adult male polar bears captured on the coast or the sea ice between 2016 and 2022. We used data from the tags to quantify the amount of time subadult and adult males spent resting versus traveling while on land. Our results show the three fur tag designs remained functional for shorter mean durations (SeaTrkr = 58 days; tribrush = 47 days; pentagon = 22 days) than ear tags (121 days), but positional error estimates were comparable among the Argos-equipped tags. The GPS/Iridium-equipped SeaTrkr fur tags provided higher resolution and more frequent location data. Combined, the tags provided sufficient data to model different behavioural states. Furthermore, as hypothesized, subadult and adult male polar bears spent the majority of their time resting while on land, increasing time spent traveling as temperatures cooled. Fur tags show promise as a short-term means of collecting movement data from free-ranging polar bears.","[Ross, Tyler R.] York Univ, Dept Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Thiemann, Gregory W.] York Univ, Fac Environm & Urban Change, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kirschhoffer, B.

Two method studies ensured our protocols could effectively recover and identify plastics in feces. First, microplastics (film, foam, or fragments) were intentionally introduced into a model organic matrix. Recovery rates (mean +/- standard deviation) averaged 95.8 +/- 14.7% (n = 18) and were significantly affected by microplastic morphology but not digestion status. Second, microplastic fragments of polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene were intentionally introduced to polar bear feces. Recovery rates averaged 79.3 +/- 21.6% (n = 8) and Raman microscopy successfully identified all three polymers in 87.5% of samples. The main study then investigated the presence of microplastics in hunter-collected polar bear feces in the Canadian Arctic. Feces from the colons of hunted bears (n = 15) and field scat (n = 15) were collected through collaboration with Inuit communities. Polypropylene, polyethylene, and/or polyethylene terephthalate were detected in the feces of eight bears. Concentrations of microplastics in feces were, on average, less than 1 particle/g dry weight feces and at or near detection limits. Overall, this work suggests microplastic ingestion by Canadian polar bears may be low and demonstrates the utility of fecal sampling for community-based monitoring programs.","[Dias, M.; Whitelaw, G.; Orihel, D.

Despite the higher bioaccumulation potential of PCAs in terrestrial ecosystems than in marine ecosystems, North American terrestrial PCA data are sparse and Arctic studies largely focus on short-chain PCAs, with minimal attention to longer-chain homologues in wildlife. This research delves into the dynamics of PCA accumulation and temporal changes across a broad spectrum of PCA homologues in polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Hudson Bay. Subcutaneous fat samples collected over the past decade from adult male polar bears of the Western Hudson Bay (WHB) and Southern Hudson Bay (SHB) subpopulations were analyzed, identifying 109 of 545 PCA homologues, ranging from C-8 to C-26. Analysis of 37 dietary fatty acids provided insights into dietary shifts and their influence on PCA profiles. Notably, SHB bears exhibited a decrease in PCA concentrations, reflecting marine food web influences. In contrast, WHB bears displayed increasing PCA levels, likely due to the use of more terrestrial and anthropogenic food sources. This study underscores the critical yet overlooked role of longer-chain PCAs in the Arctic food web and polar bear exposure, emphasizing the variance between subpopulations and the significant impact of dietary factors.","[Yuan, Bo] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Letcher, Robert J.] Carleton Univ, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ecotoxicol & Wildlife Hlth Div, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; National Wildlife Research Centre - Canada; Carleton University,"Yuan, B (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.;Letcher, RJ (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ecotoxicol & Wildlife Hlth Div, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H3, Canada.",bo.yuan@ntnu.no; robert.letcher@ec.gc.ca,,"Yuan, Bo/0000-0002-2043-8128; Letcher, Robert/0000-0002-8232-8565",Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; Whale Cove; Environment and Climate Change Canada; Northern Contaminants Program,Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada; Whale Cove; Environment and Climate Change Canada; Northern Contaminants Program,"The authors thank Amelie Roberto-Charron, Alyssa Bohart, and Markus Dyck (deceased) at the Nunavut Department of Environment for partnership in the polar bear contaminant monitoring program.

As the climate warms, polar bears will be forced to move to more suitable habitats which are likely to shrink, adapt to the new conditions, or decline in population size. However, the genomic diversity within and among all 19 subpopulations of polar bears, and therefore their adaptive potential, is currently unknown. In addition, warmer climates are likely to result in more frequent contact between polar bears and grizzly bears (U. arctos), with which they can hybridize. Here we describe the development, quality control, and application of the Ursus maritimus V2 SNP chip. This 8 K SNP chip contains loci explicitly selected to assess both RAD-derived and transcriptome-derived loci, as well as SNPs to detect hybridization between species. A total of 7,239 loci (90.3% of those printed) were successfully genotyped, with over 99% genotype concordance for individuals typed in duplicate on this chip, and between individuals typed here and on the Ursus maritimus V1 SNP chip. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the markers have high accuracy and efficiency to detect hybridization and backcrosses between polar bears and grizzly bears. However, empirical analysis of 371 polar bears, 440 grizzly bears, and 8 known hybrids found no novel instances of recent hybridization. The Ursus maritimus V2 SNP chip provides a powerful tool for monitoring the adaptive potential of this species along with assessing population structure, quantitative genomics, and hybridization in polar bears.","[Miller, Joshua M.; Rivkin, L.

Captive breeding represents one essential facet of species conservation, but aspects of the polar bear's reproductive physiology, such as follicle maturation, coitus-induced ovulation, and pseudopregnancy, are poorly characterized and present challenges for enhancing natural reproductive success and the application of advanced reproductive techniques. Due to the absence of a reliable transrectal or transabdominal ultrasound method for ovarian examination in the species, the ovaries of two adult female polar bears were examined laparoscopically to evaluate the feasibility of surgical access to the ovaries, oviduct, and uterus. The minimally invasive procedure was easily and rapidly performed in both bears and all procedures. Direct visual assessment of the ovary was possible after dissection of a fatty bursal sac, which completely enclosed the ovaries. In the second bear, laparoscopic manipulation of the ovary to draw it closer to the body wall enabled transcutaneous ultrasound. Laparoscopy may be a valuable tool to aid in the application of advanced reproductive technologies in polar bears.","[Aldrich, Ellison D.] Massy Univ, Sch Vet Sci, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand; [Hendrickson, Dean A.] Colorado State Univ, Coll Vet Med & Biomed Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA; [Schmitt, Todd L.] SeaWorld Calif, 500 Sea World Dr, San Diego, CA 92109 USA; [Nollens, Hendrik H.] Sand Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, 15500 San Pasqual Valley Rd, Escondido, CA 92027 USA; [Montano, Gisele; Steinman, Karen J.; Robeck, Todd R.] SeaWorld Pk & Entertainment Corp, Species Preservat Lab, 2595 Ingraham Rd, San Diego, CA 92109 USA; [O'Brien, Justine K.] Taronga Conservat Soc Australia, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia",Colorado State University System; Colorado State University Fort Collins; Taronga Conservation Society Australia,"Hendrickson, DA (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Coll Vet Med & Biomed Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA.",dean.hendrickson@colostate.edu; todd.robeck@seaworld.com,"; O'Brien, Justine/C-3596-2017","Schmitt, Todd/0000-0001-7703-1540; O'Brien, Justine/0000-0003-2011-9626; Nollens, Henik/0000-0002-1653-9583; Montano, Gisele/0000-0001-7791-2428; Robeck, Todd/0000-0001-8573-5070; Henickson, Dean/0000-0003-2246-9742",SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment,SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment,"The authors thank the animal training, curatorial, and veterinary staff at SeaWorld San Diego and staff at the SeaWorld and Busch Gardens Reproductive Research Center for their assistance, and in particular, all Wild Arctic staff.

It is uncertain if Arctic wildlife will have sufficient time to adapt to such rapidly warming environments. We used genetic forecasting to measure the risk of maladaptation to warming temperatures and sea ice loss in polar bears (Ursus maritimus) sampled across the Canadian Arctic. We found evidence for local adaptation to sea ice conditions and temperature. Forecasting of genome-environment mismatches for predicted climate scenarios suggested that polar bears in the Canadian high Arctic had the greatest risk of becoming maladapted to climate warming. While Canadian high Arctic bears may be the most likely to become maladapted, all polar bears face potentially negative outcomes to climate change. Given the importance of the sea ice habitat to polar bears, we expect that maladaptation to future warming is already widespread across Canada.","[Rivkin, L.

In the United States, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) protects polar bears from incidental disturbance from human activities. For the remote and roadless areas of northern Alaska, USA, effective management of small aircraft activity is necessary to limit disturbance, but effects of overflights on polar bear behavior are largely unknown. During 2021 and 2022, we intentionally exposed polar bears (n = 115) to systematic aircraft activity (helicopter, fixed-wing) until we observed a disruption of behavior that qualified as a level B take response (e.g., abrupt change in activity or movement) under the MMPA. We used a Bayesian logistic regression to determine what factors influence and can be used to predict when a polar bear will exhibit a level B take response and estimate the probability of an aircraft eliciting a level B take response at different altitudes above the polar bear. Aircraft type, flight altitude, landscape (barrier islands vs. mainland), and bear behavior (active vs. inactive) upon initial aircraft encounter were all important predictors of take. Probability of take rapidly increased with a decrease in flight altitude starting at 450 m for helicopter and 300 m for fixed-wing aircraft. Active (e.g., standing, walking) polar bears on barrier-island landscapes were more likely to experience take than inactive (e.g., bedded) bears on mainland landscapes. Our findings can help with assessments and management plans by quantifying disturbance to polar bears from current and future human activity that involves aircraft use.","[Quigley, Gwendolyn; Brinkman, Todd J.] Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, 2140 Koyukuk Dr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Wilson, Ryan; Christ, Aaron] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, 1011 E Tudor Rd, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service,"Brinkman, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, 2140 Koyukuk Dr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",tjbrinkman@alaska.edu,"Brinkman, Todd/B-3578-2013",,"Institute of Arctic Biology, University of Alaska Fairbanks; USFWS; United States Geological Survey Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center; Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks","Institute of Arctic Biology, University of Alaska Fairbanks; USFWS(US Fish & Wildlife Service); United States Geological Survey Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center; Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks","The findings and conclusions in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the USFWS.

Many of these regions have had limited development, so understanding potential impacts to wildlife could inform management decisions. In 2017, the United States passed legislation allowing oil and gas development in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Alaska. This area has received limited industrial development and is an important region for polar bears that use the coastline as a travel corridor in autumn. We sought to understand how an autumn near-shore oil spill in the Refuge could affect polar bears. We simulated oil spills from shallow sub-sea pipelines at 3 locations along the coastline of the Refuge and allowed spills to discharge 4800 barrels of oil per day for 6 days, and tracked oil for 50 days. We interacted the trajectories with simulated polar bear movements to estimate how many bears might be exposed. Oil spread quickly along the coastline and during some weeks exposed an average of 10 bears (95 % CI: 0-37) to lethal levels of oil, and 60 (95 % CI: 9-120) to sub-lethal levels. Our results suggest a significant number of polar bears could become oiled from a spill in the region and require decontamination.

The fecal microbiome of habitat-housed captive polar bears who had consumed a high protein diet long-term was compared with that of the wild population. Individual differences, season, year and dietary inclusion of a brown seaweed (Fucus spiralis; part of the natural diet of wild polar bears), as a representation for nutritional change, were investigated for their effects on the fecal microbiome of captive polar bears. Microbial variations among fecal samples from wild and captive polar bears were investigated using 16s rRNA gene based metataxonomic profiling. The captive bears exhibited more diverse fecal microbiota than wild bears (p<0.05). The difference was due to significantly increased Firmicutes, Campilobacterota and Fusobacteriota, decreased Actinobacteriota (p<0.05), and absent Bdellovibrionota and Verrucomicrobiota in the captive bears. Compared with other factors, individual variation was the main driver of differences in fecal microbial composition in the captive bears. Seaweed consumption did not alter microbial diversity or composition, but this did not rule out dietary influences on the hosts. This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, comparing the fecal microbiota of captive and wild polar bears and it reveals distinct differences between the two groups, which could result from many factors, including available food sources and the ratio of dietary macronutrients. Our findings provide preliminary insights into climate-change induced dietary shifts in polar bears related to climate-associated habitat change.","[Lu, Jing; Collins, Stephanie Anne] Dalhousie Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Anim Sci & Aquaculture, Truro, NS, Canada; [Petri, Renee] Agr & Agrifood Canada, Sherbrooke Res & Dev Ctr, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [McCart, Dylan] Churchill Northern Studies Ctr, Churchill, MB, Canada; [Baxendell-Young, Amy] Cochrane Polar Bear Habitat, Cochrane, ON, Canada",Dalhousie University; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada,"Lu, J; Collins, SA (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Anim Sci & Aquaculture, Truro, NS, Canada.",s.collins@dal.ca; jinglu@dal.ca,"Petri, Renée/J-6102-2019","Petri, Renee/0000-0002-8209-8261","Dalhousie University Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Animal Science and Aquaculture; Cochrane Polar Bear Habitat","Dalhousie University Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Animal Science and Aquaculture; Cochrane Polar Bear Habitat","The authors would thank Inukshuk, Ganuk, Henry, Eddy and the wild polar bears who contributed samples that were included in this research.

Current management practices include pairing mates at five to six years of age, but there is evidence that wild bears have sired cubs as early as two years old. Timing acquisition of sexual maturity in male polar bears could aid in determining when mates should be paired in ex situ populations. To address this, non-invasive fecal testosterone metabolite monitoring was evaluated as a technique for establishing age of sexual maturity in 14 male polar bears (aged 1-6.9 years) for 1-6 years. Testosterone metabolite concentrations were monitored throughout the year and evaluated by breeding season (Jan. 1-May 21) compared to non-breeding season (May 22-Dec. 31). Sexual maturity was defined as when testosterone metabolite concentrations were significantly greater during breeding season than non-breeding season and bi-weekly averages were elevated above baseline for a minimum of ten weeks during breeding season mimicking patterns in adult male polar bears. Testosterone metabolite concentrations ranged from 5.9 to 8342 ng/g. One bear met the defined criteria at two years of age and an additional three bears met criteria at three years old. Due to the sampling strategy and the requirements set forth by the definition of sexual maturity, there were confounding results. In two cases, bears determined to be sexually mature the year prior, were not categorized as mature the next year. Another bear demonstrated greater testosterone metabolite values during the non-breeding season than breeding season. This study demonstrated the variability in fecal testosterone metabolites in juvenile polar bears and results suggest that hormone assessment alone is not adequate for determining sexual maturity in ex situ male polar bears. However, if used in tandem with behavioral monitoring and semen collection, when possible, could aid breeding management decisions for ex situ populations.","[Wojtusik, Jessye; Philpott, Megan; Donelan, Elizabeth; Stoops, Monica A.; Roth, Terri L.; Curry, Erin] Cincinnati Zoo & Bot Garden, Ctr Conservat & Res Endangered Wildlife, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA; [Wojtusik, Jessye; Stoops, Monica A.] Omahas Henry Doorly Zoo & Aquarium, Dept Reprod Sci, Omaha, NE 68107 USA",,"Curry, E (corresponding author), Cincinnati Zoo & Bot Garden, Ctr Conservat & Res Endangered Wildlife, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA.",erin.curry@cincinnatizoo.org,"; Wojtusik, Jessye/AAY-1654-2021","Wojtusik, Jessye/0000-0002-8603-7407; Curry, Erin/0000-0001-8043-3460;",Institute of Museum and Library Services [MA-30-18-0461-18],Institute of Museum and Library Services,"This research was funded in part by the Institute of Museum and Library Services grant #MA-30-18-0461-18.

Blood-based biomarkers are used to assess the physiologic health of individuals but their usefulness for evaluating population health, especially as it relates to changing environmental conditions, has rarely been explored. We describe links between environmental conditions and physiologic functions of southern Beaufort Sea polar bears using data from blood samples collected from 1984 to 2018, a period marked by extensive environmental change. We evaluated associations between 13 physiologic biomarkers and circumpolar (Arctic oscillation index) and regional (wind patterns and ice-free days) environmental metrics and seasonal and demographic co-variates (age, sex, season, and year) known to affect polar bear ecology. We observed signs of dysregulation of water balance in polar bears following years with a lower annual Arctic oscillation index. In addition, liver enzyme values increased over time, which is suggestive of potential hepatocyte damage as the Arctic has warmed. Biomarkers of immune function increased with regional-scale wind patterns and the number of ice-free days over the Beaufort Sea continental shelf and were lower in years with a lower winter Arctic oscillation index, suggesting an increased allocation of energetic resources for immune processes under these conditions. We propose that the variation in polar bear immune and metabolic function is likely indicative of physiologic plasticity, a response that allows polar bears to remain in homeostasis even as they experience changes in nutrition and habitat in response to changing environments.","[Fry, Tricia L.; Friedrichs, Kristen R.; Goldberg, Tony L.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, 1656 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Ketz, Alison C.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Wisconsin Cooperat Res Unit, Madison, WI USA; [Duncan, Colleen] Colorado State Univ, Coll Vet Med & Biomed Sci, Dept Microbiol Immunol & Pathol, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Van Deelen, Timothy R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI USA; [Atwood, Todd C.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Colorado State University System; Colorado State University Fort Collins; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey,"Fry, TL (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, 1656 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",tfry@wisc.edu,"; VANDEELEN, TIMOTHY/KWU-1140-2024","Goldberg, Tony/0000-0003-3962-4913; Atwood, Todd/0000-0002-1971-3110; Fry, Tricia/0000-0003-1506-048X; Duncan, Colleen/0000-0001-8402-9238",Rob and Bessie Welder Wildlife Foundation [WT-332]; U.S. Geological Survey [G16AC00384zz],Rob and Bessie Welder Wildlife Foundation; U.S. Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey),"Rob and Bessie Welder Wildlife Foundation, Grant/Award Number: WT-332; U.S. Geological Survey, Grant/Award Number: G16AC00384zz",,105,7,7,7,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

We identified 48 anelloviruses, which in humans are linked to immunosuppression. Polar bear anelloviruses did not vary with physiological, behavioral or demographic factors, but do appear to change with time. These data provide a baseline for assessing future changes. Climate change affects the behavior, physiology and life history of many Arctic wildlife species. It can also influence the distribution and ecology of infectious agents. The southern Beaufort Sea (SB) subpopulation of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) has experienced dramatic behavioral changes due to retreating sea ice and other climate-related factors, but the effects of these changes on physiology and infection remain poorly understood. Using serum from polar bears sampled between 2004 and 2015 and metagenomic DNA sequencing, we identified 48 viruses, all of the family Anelloviridae. Anelloviruses are small, ubiquitous infectious agents with circular single-stranded DNA genomes that are not known to cause disease but, in humans, covary in diversity and load with immunological compromise. We therefore examined the usefulness of anelloviruses as biomarkers of polar bear physiological stress related to climate and habitat use. Polar bear anelloviruses sorted into two distinct clades on a phylogenetic tree, both of which also contained anelloviruses of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), another ursid. Neither anellovirus diversity nor load were associated with any demographic variables, behavioral factors or direct physiological measures. However, pairwise genetic distances between anelloviruses were positively correlated with pairwise differences in sampling date, suggesting that the polar bear anellome is evolving over time. These findings suggest that anelloviruses are not a sensitive indicator of polar physiological stress, but they do provide a baseline for evaluating future changes to polar bear viromes.","[Fry, Tricia L.; Owens, Leah A.; Dunay, Emily; Goldberg, Tony L.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Ketz, Alison C.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Wisconsin Cooperat Res Unit, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Atwood, Todd C.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Fry, Tricia L.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Vet Med, Hanson Labs, 1656 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Fry, TL (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Vet Med, Hanson Labs, 1656 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",tfry@wisc.edu; leah.owens@wisc.edu; aketz@wisc.edu; tatwood@usgs.gov; dunay@wisc.edu; tony.goldberg@wisc.edu,"Owens, Leah/NBW-8604-2025","Goldberg, Tony/0000-0003-3962-4913; Owens, Leah/0000-0002-4232-3516; Fry, Tricia/0000-0003-1506-048X; Dunay, Emily/0000-0002-5689-8118",NIH HHS [T32 OD010423] Funding Source: Medline,NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),,,79,3,3,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2051-1434,,,CONSERV PHYSIOL,Conserv.

In the Arctic, earlier sea-ice loss is driving polar bears (Ursus maritimus) onto land when many colonial nesting seabirds are breeding. The result is a higher threat of nest predation for birds with potential limited ability to respond. We quantified heart rate change in a large common eider (Somateria mollissima) breeding colony in the Canadian Arctic to explore their adaptive capacity to keep pace with the increasing risk of egg predation by polar bears. Eiders displayed on average higher heart rates from baseline when polar bears were within their field of view. Moreover, eiders were insensitive to variation in the distance bears were to their nests, but exhibited mild bradycardia (lowered heart rate) the longer the eider was exposed to the bear given the hen's visibility. Results indicate that a limited ability to assess the risks posed by polar bears may result in long-term fitness consequences for eiders from the increasing frequency in interactions with this predator.","[Geldart, Erica A.; Barnas, Andrew F.; Semeniuk, Christina A.

Here, we review two prior generations of Bayesian network probability models predicting changes in global polar bear (Ursus maritimus) population status, and provide a contemporary update based on recent research findings and sea-ice projections by newer climate models. We compare predictions of polar bear population response from all 3 models among four circumpolar Arctic ecoregions, using sea ice projections based on three IPCC greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (SSP2.6, 4.5, 8.5). Consistent with the previous two model generations, polar bears will continue to experience increasing probability of declining or greatly declining populations throughout the 21st century, varying by emission scenario. Populations within the Polar Basin Divergent Ice Ecoregion have the highest predicted probability of declines, but predictions were slightly less dire relative to the previous model generation. Most of the influence, denoted by model sensitivity analysis, is from expected degradation and loss of sea ice and reduced access to marine prey. The lack of terrestrial prey adequate to substitute for loss of access to marine prey, as well as human-caused bear morality associated with hunting and defense of life and property encountered when polar bears are increasingly forced ashore also contributed to predicted declines. Although some tidewater glacial fjords and other localized onshore resources may provide local refugia, their benefit is transient. Our findings continue to inform priorities for inventory, monitoring, and research needs, and suggest that similar updates to models of other at-risk species can capitalize on the comparison framework we present here.","[Marcot, Bruce G.] US Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Portland, OR 97204 USA; [Atwood, Todd C.; Bromaghin, Jeffrey F.; Pagano, Anthony M.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Douglas, David C.] US Geol Survey, Alaska Sci Ctr, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Amstrup, Steven C.] Polar Bears Int, Bozeman, MT 59772 USA; [Marcot, Bruce G.] US Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Portland Forestry Sci Lab, USDA, 1220 SW 3rd Ave,Suite 1410, Portland, OR 97204 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"Marcot, BG (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, Pacific Northwest Res Stn, Portland Forestry Sci Lab, USDA, 1220 SW 3rd Ave,Suite 1410, Portland, OR 97204 USA.",bruce.marcot@usda.gov,"Douglas, David/AAU-1087-2021; Bromaghin, Jeffrey/B-5058-2009",,"U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station","U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service)","Marcot acknowledges support by U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station.

Previous research has used Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) technology to detect bear dens but has only achieved a detection accuracy of 45% for single flights. The thermal nature of FLIR means that some bears are never detected nor are detectable using FLIR. In this paper we explore the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as an alternative polar bear detection technology in a simple pilot study in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, during October 2021. In this experimental study, we focused on the detection of polar bears on the surface in the SAR images. The result of this study can inform future efforts to proceed to den-detection experiments. In this study, we achieved a polar bear identification accuracy of 66%, albeit with a small sample size. Many of the challenges we encountered involved low signal-to-noise ratios and imprecise flight paths. Concurrent research from other parties shows that neural networks and other machine learning techniques can overcome these challenges to some degree, suggesting that SAR may be a promising candidate to become an effective tool for polar bear detection, particularly when coupled with other sensors such as FLIR.","[George, Brent; Bateman, Terri; Formica, Mckay; Hilke, Nicholas; Smith, Tom; Stock, Lucas; Long, David] Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84604 USA; [Gronnemose, Wyatt; Iqbal, Usman; Rabus, Bernhard; Stacey, Jeff] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Kirschoffer, B.

This admixture event cannot be detected using genomic data from living polar bears. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) and brown bears (Ursus arctos) are sister species possessing distinct physiological and behavioural adaptations that evolved over the last 500,000 years. However, comparative and population genomics analyses have revealed that several extant and extinct brown bear populations have relatively recent polar bear ancestry, probably as the result of geographically localized instances of gene flow from polar bears into brown bears. Here, we generate and analyse an approximate 20X paleogenome from an approximately 100,000-year-old polar bear that reveals a massive prehistoric admixture event, which is evident in the genomes of all living brown bears. This ancient admixture event was not visible from genomic data derived from living polar bears. Like more recent events, this massive admixture event mainly involved unidirectional gene flow from polar bears into brown bears and occurred as climate changes caused overlap in the ranges of the two species. These findings highlight the complex reticulate paths that evolution can take within a regime of radically shifting climate.","[Wang, Ming-Shan; Supple, Megan A.; Shapiro, Beth] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Wang, Ming-Shan; Vershinina, Alisa O.; Supple, Megan A.; Kapp, Joshua D.; Crump, Sarah E.; Shapiro, Beth] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Murray, Gemma G.

ST data provide biological information relevant to subpopulation delineation, movements, habitat use, maternal denning, health, human-bear interactions, and accurate estimates of vital rates and abundance. Given that polar bears are distributed at low densities over vast and remote habitats, much of the information provided by ST data cannot be collected by other means. Obtaining ST data for polar bears requires chemical immobilization and application of a tracking device. Although immobilization has not been found to have negative effects beyond a several-day reduction in activity, over the last few decades opposition to immobilization and deployment of satellite-linked radio collars has resulted in a lack of current ST data in many of the 19 recognized polar bear subpopulations. Here, we review the uses of ST data for polar bears and evaluate its role in addressing 21(st) century conservation and management challenges, which include estimation of sustainable harvest rates, understanding the impacts of climate warming, delineating critical habitat, and assessing potential anthropogenic impacts from tourism, resource development and extraction. We found that in subpopulations where ST data have been consistently collected, information was available to estimate vital rates and subpopulation density, document the effects of sea-ice loss, and inform management related to subsistence harvest and regulatory requirements. In contrast, a lack of ST data in some subpopulations resulted in increased bias and uncertainty in ecological and demographic parameters, which has a range of negative consequences. As sea-ice loss due to climate warming continues, there is a greater need to monitor polar bear distribution, habitat use, abundance, and subpopulation connectivity. We conclude that continued collection of ST data will be critically important for polar bear management and conservation in the 21(st) century and that the benefits of immobilizing small numbers of individual polar bears in order to deploy ST devices significantly outweigh the risks.",,,,,"; Routti, Heli/AAM-7884-2020; aars, jon/AAB-3076-2021","Aars, Jon/0000-0002-0574-6712;",NASA [80NSSC18K1229],NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),Funding Authors were supported by their individual agencies.

Throughout much of their range, polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are increasingly using terrestrial habitats in response to Arctic sea ice decline. Their increased presence in coastal areas has implications for bear-human conflict, inter-species interactions, and polar bear health and survival. We examined observed trends in land use over three decades by polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea (SB) and Chukchi Sea (CS) where bears have traditionally spent most of the year on the sea ice. Using data from 408 adult females fitted with satellite radio-collars, we examined trends in the annual proportion of bears coming onshore (hereafter referred to as percent of bears) during the summer for >= 21 days, arrival and departure dates, duration spent onshore and relationships with sea ice metrics. We then estimated future land use through 2040 by extrapolating trends and by combining observed relationships between land use and sea ice with projections of future sea ice from an ensemble of earth system models. The observed percent of bears summering onshore and their duration onshore was correlated with the percent of open water that occurred within their population's range between July and October. As sea ice declined, the percent of bears summering onshore increased from similar to 5-30% in the SB and similar to 10-50% in the CS and duration onshore increased by > 30 days to 60-70 days in both populations. Using a range of greenhouse gas emission scenarios and adjustments for faster than forecasted sea ice loss we estimated that 50-62% of SB and 79-88% of CS bears will spend 90-108 and 110-126 days onshore during summer in the SB and CS, respectively, by 2040. Sea ice projections varied little between greenhouse gas emission scenarios prior to 2040 but diverged thereafter. Observed and forecasted increases in polar bear land occupancy puts more bears in proximity to human activities and settlements for longer durations while extending the lack of access to their primary prey. Because human conflict is one of the primary factors affecting the conservation of large carnivores worldwide, mitigation of bear-human interactions on land will be an increasingly important component of polar bear conservation.","[Rode, Karyn D.; Atwood, T.

Food-seeking behaviours by black bears Ursus americanus and brown bears Ursus arctos can lead to property damage, human injury and mortality of the offending bears. Such conflicts are a well-known conservation management issue wherever people live in bear habitats. In contrast, the use of anthropogenic foods by the polar bear Ursus maritimus is less common historically but is a growing conservation and management issue across the Arctic. Here we present six case studies that illustrate how negative food-related interactions between humans and polar bears can become either chronic or ephemeral and unpredictable. Our examination suggests that attractants are an increasing problem, exacerbated by climate change-driven sea-ice losses that cause increased use of terrestrial habitats by bears. Growing human populations and increased human visitation increase the likelihood of human-polar bear conflict. Efforts to reduce food conditioning in polar bears include attractant management, proactive planning and adequate resources for northern communities to reduce conflicts and improve human safety. Permanent removal of unsecured sources of nutrition, to reduce food conditioning, should begin immediately at the local level as this will help to reduce polar bear mortality.","[Smith, Tom S.] Brigham Young Univ, Wildlife & Wildlands Conservat Program, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Derocher, Andrew E.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Mazur, Rachel L.] Olymp Natl Pk, Inventory & Monitoring Div, Port Angeles, WA USA; [York, Geoff] Polar Bears Int, Bozeman, MT USA; [Owen, Megan A.] San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, Escondido, CA USA; [Obbard, Martyn] Trent Univ, Ontario Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, DNA Bldg, Peterborough, ON, Canada; [Richardson, Evan S.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Wildlife Res Div, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Amstrup, Steven C.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",Brigham Young University; University of Alberta; Ministry of Natural Resources & Forestry; Trent University; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Wildlife Research Division - Environment Canada; University of Wyoming,"Smith, TS (corresponding author), Brigham Young Univ, Wildlife & Wildlands Conservat Program, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",tom_smith@byu.edu,"Derocher, Andrew/J-4469-2012; Derocher, Anew/J-4469-2012; Obbard, Martyn/AFU-0326-2022","Owen, Megan/0000-0003-1655-3972; Derocher, Anew/0000-0002-1104-7774; Richardson, Evan/0000-0003-3172-5592; Obbard, Martyn/0000-0003-2064-0155",,,,,83,12,13,3,69,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0030-6053,1365-3008,,ORYX,Oryx,JUL,2023,57.0,4,,,,,425.0,434,PII S0030605322000278,10.1017/S0030605322000278,0,,JUL 2022,10,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,W7NT4,,gold,,,2025-12-15,WOS:000827879700001,0,polarbears

In northern Alaska, USA, sea ice loss has increased the frequency of land-based polar bear Ursus maritimus maternal dens, leading to greater potential for overlap between industrial activities and denning bears. Responses of denning bears to human disturbance could result in costly reproductive outcomes, although observation of these responses is logistically challenging and expensive. We developed a method to standardize the process of classifying the response of denning polar bears to disturbance using decision rules based on polar bear biology and denning chronology. We applied this method to 46 maternal polar bear dens exposed to human activity (e.g. vehicle traffic, ground-based monitoring). Because the timing of disturbance influences the response and subsequent fitness consequences, we determined outcomes specific to 4 denning periods: (1) den establishment (excavation to cub birth); (2) early denning (cub birth to 60 d old); (3) late denning (60 d old to emergence); and (4) post-emergence (emergence to den site departure). We classified the outcomes of 79 exposures as 37 having 'no documented effect' (no observed response), 7 as 'behavioral' (observed behavioral disruption), 17 as 'early emergence' (den emergence occurring earlier than an undisturbed emergence), 14 as 'early departure' (den site abandonment post-emergence earlier than if undisturbed), and 4 as 'cub mortality' (death or abandonment of >= 1 cub). Outcomes with potential fitness consequences occurred in every denning period. Our classification method facilitated a standardized approach that can be used to classify the outcome of den disturbance. Determining outcomes in relation to a specific denning period may facilitate improved implementation of mitigation strategies to reduce disturbance to denning bears.","[Woodruff, Susannah P.; Andersen, Erik M.; Wilson, Ryan R.; Mangipane, Lindsey S.; Miller, Susanne B.; Klein, Kimberly J.; Lemons, Patrick R.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA; [Klein, Kimberly J.] Bur Energy & Ocean Management, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA",United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service,"Woodruff, SP (corresponding author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Anchorage, AK 99503 USA.",susannah_woodruff@fws.gov,,,,,,,114,7,7,1,35,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",1863-5407,1613-4796,,ENDANGER SPECIES RES,Endanger.

We investigated the cortisol response of polar bears to increasing ambient temperatures to improve our knowledge of the physiology of this Arctic species with the goal of informing management in zoos and in the wild. In adult polar bears temperatures above 20 degrees C were associated with an increase in the hormone cortisol to accommodate increased thermoregulatory demands. This temperature threshold was surprisingly high for an Arctic-adapted species. Zoos can provide sufficient housing options to prevent overheating in polar bears exposed to warmer temperatures but our results are concerning for wild polar bears. The number of days reaching 20 degrees C in the Arctic has increased significantly over the past 30 years and the associated increase in thermoregulatory costs add to the physiological burden many wild polar bears are already facing with the loss of sea ice hunting opportunities. We recommend that the management of polar bears in the wild and under human care be adapted to reflect the increased cortisol concentrations associated with thermoregulatory challenges in warmer temperatures. Our objective was to identify the upper ambient temperature threshold that triggers an increase in cortisol in response to increased thermoregulatory demands in polar bears. The results reported here include endocrine data collected over two years from 25 polar bears housed in 11 accredited zoological institutions across North America. The effects of ambient temperature, sex, age group (juvenile, adult, elderly), breeding season and humidity on fecal cortisol metabolite (FCM) concentrations (N = 8439 samples) were evaluated using linear mixed models. Ambient temperatures were placed into five different categories: <5 degrees C, 6-10 degrees C, 11-15 degrees C, 16-20 degrees C, and >20 degrees C. Ambient temperature and humidity had a significant (p < 0.05) effect on FCM concentrations with significant (p < 0.05) interactions of sex, age and breeding season. Once biotic factors were accounted for, there was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in FCM concentrations associated with ambient temperatures above 20 degrees C in adult polar bears. The implications of these findings for the management of both zoo and wild polar bears are discussed.","[Leishman, Emily M.] Univ Guelph, Dept Anim Biosci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Franke, Maria] Toronto Zoo, Toronto, ON M1B 5K7, Canada; [Marvin, Jill] Magnet Hill Zoo & Pk, Moncton, NB E1G 4V7, Canada; [McCart, Dylan] Churchill Northern Studies Ctr, Churchill, MB R0B 0E0, Canada; [Bradford, Carol] Albuquerque BioPk, Albuquerque, NM 87102 USA; [Gyimesi, Zoltan S.] Louisville Zoo, Louisville, KY 40213 USA; [Nichols, Anne] Brookfield Zoo, Brookfield, IL 60513 USA; [Lessard, Marie-Pierre] Soc Outdoor Estab Quebec Sepaq, Quebec City, PQ G1W 4S3, Canada; [Page, David] Zoo Sauvage St Felicien, St Felicien, PQ G8K 0H1, Canada; [Breiter, C-Jae] Assiniboine Pk Zoo, Winnipeg, MB R3R 2N7, Canada; [Graham, Laura H.] WRG Conservat Fdn, West Montrose, ON N0B 2V0, Canada",University of Guelph,"Graham, LH (corresponding author), WRG Conservat Fdn, West Montrose, ON N0B 2V0, Canada.",eleishma@uoguelph.ca; mfranke@torontozoo.ca; jill.marvin@moncton.ca; dylan.mccart@churchillscience.ca; cbradford@cabq.gov; zoli.gyimesi@louisvilleky.gov; anne.nichols@czs.org; lessard.mariepierre@sepaq.com; david.page@zoosauvage.org; cbreiter@assiniboinepark.ca; endolaura@yahoo.com,,"Breiter, C-Jae/0009-0001-7139-0056; Leishman, Emily/0000-0003-1739-3915",Campbell Centre for the Study of AnimalUniversity of Guelph; WRG Conservation Foundation,Campbell Centre for the Study of AnimalUniversity of Guelph; WRG Conservation Foundation,Research grants were obtained from the Campbell Centre for the Study of AnimalUniversity of Guelph (2014/2015).

We also utilize the DCC-GARCH-t copula approach to examine the hedging effectiveness of the Australian sustainable and Islamic financial markets against the Australian conventional market's long-term volatility during high and low uncertainty. The time domain QVAR approach show that the Australian sustainable financial market returns receive the highest spillovers of shocks from TPU, FSI and GPR at the lower, medium and higher quantiles. Moreover, in the short term, at the lower quantiles the sustainable financial market receives the highest error variance contributions from FSI, while at higher quantiles, TPU, FSI and GPR transmit higher spillovers of shocks towards the sustainable market. Similarly, in the long term, the sustainable market receives the highest contributions to the error variances from TPU, FSI and GPR (GPR and TPU) at the lower (higher) quantiles. Moreover, at the lower, middle and higher quantiles, a shock in the Islamic (sustainable) market returns causes the highest contribution of error variances in the conventional market, compared with the (sustainable) Islamic market in the short and long run. Finally, the hedging strategy results show that investment in the Islamic financial market is the cheapest hedge against the long-term conventional market risk during high and low uncertainty periods.","[Sheikh, Umaid A.] Univ Cent Punjab, Fac Management Sci, Lahore, Pakistan; [Asadi, Mehrad] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Hlth Econ, Tehran, Iran; [Roubaud, David] Univ Montpellier, Montpellier Res Management, Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Roubaud, David] Woxsen Univ, Sch Business, Hyderabad, India; [Hammoudeh, Shawkat] Drexel Univ, Lebow Coll Business, Merion Stn, PA 19104 USA; [Hammoudeh, Shawkat] Vietnam Ind Univ Ho Chi Minh City, Univ Econ & Law, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",University of Central Punjab; Tarbiat Modares University; Universite de Montpellier; Montpellier Business School; Woxsen University; Drexel University; Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNUHCM) System; VNU-HCM University of Economics & Law (VNUHCM-UEL),"Hammoudeh, S (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Lebow Coll Business, Merion Stn, PA 19104 USA.;Hammoudeh, S (corresponding author), Vietnam Ind Univ Ho Chi Minh City, Univ Econ & Law, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",umaidsheikh@ucp.edu.pk; mehrad.asadi@modares.ac.ir; d.roubaud@montpellier-bs.com; shawkat.hammoudeh@gmail.com,"ROUBAUD, DAVID/ABA-8123-2020; Hammoudeh, Shawkat/ADB-7473-2022","Sheikh, Umaid A/0000-0001-8181-6498",,,,,120,39,42,6,48,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1057-5219,1873-8079,,INT REV FINANC ANAL,Int.

Against the backdrop of financial globalization, the high volatility of cryptocurrency prices may pose a threat to the stability of the entire financial system. To explore the potential association and transmission of financial risks between cryptocurrency and traditional financial assets, this paper constructs a complex network using the Granger causality method and the DY spillover method. Based on data from 24 categories of assets or index returns from different markets, networks of association and risk spillover between cryptocurrency market and traditional financial markets are established under different time periods, the study covers the period from January 2015 to November 2023. Analyzing the mutual influence between cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets from the perspective of complex networks, and evaluating the market positioning, risk characteristics, and investment potential of cryptocurrency. Research findings indicate that cryptocurrency possesses not only monetary characteristics but also functions as an investment tool, significantly impacting the stability of traditional financial markets. Furthermore, different types of cryptocurrencies vary in market functions, risk characteristics, and investment potentials. Future research could further explore the nonlinear and dynamic associations between cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets, as well as the micro mechanisms and behavioral factors within cryptocurrency markets.","[Zhou, Fan] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Finance & Economics,"Zhou, F (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",85977670@qq.com,,"Zhou, Fan/0009-0000-2668-9975",,,,,43,11,11,14,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-4371,1873-2119,,PHYSICA A,Physica A,AUG 15,2024,648.0,,,,,,,,129955.0,10.1016/j.physa.2024.129955,0,,JUL 2024,18,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physics,A0E6D,,,,,2025-12-15,WOS:001279360600001,0,financialmarkets

Applying conditional and aggregated connectedness approaches, we systematically uncover the multi-dimensional interlinkages to understand volatility transmissions within these markets. Results reveal that COVOL predominantly receives volatility transmissions, with the US and European stock markets acting as principal transmitters of shocks across all three regional systems. The research also highlights the crucial role of significant events, such as the Global Financial Crisis, the Chinese stock market crash, and the COVID-19 pandemic, when increasing the intensity of connectedness. The volatility transmission of the COVOL-gold pairing is comparatively weaker than the COVOL-stock and COVOL-oil pairs. At the same time, the US and Europe consistently transmit stronger shocks to global financial risk, contributing significantly to the global risk transmission channel, whereas, in contrast, China's financial markets transmit less international uncertainty.

Moreover, we employed the novel technique of conditional autoregressive value-at-risk (CAViaR) along with time-varying parameters vector autoregressions (TVP-VAR) to indicate asymmetries among these financial markets. We found strong intra-class connectedness clusters with little interconnectedness among the markets. Subsequently, the time-varying trends highlighted extreme risk spillovers during the crisis times.

However, the existing literature has relatively little empirical evidence on the risk spillover effects of GPR and multiple representative financial markets. Based on a time-varying frequency risk spillover network model, this paper examines the risk spillover effects across GPR and global stock markets, foreign exchange markets, bond markets, crude oil markets, and gold markets from both short-term and long-term perspectives. It found that (1) global foreign exchange and bond markets act as the center of global financial risk spillover networks, and GPR is more closely linked to crude oil markets; (2) the entire risk spillover network is mainly driven by short-term risk spillovers, but under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk spillover network is dominated by long-term risk spillovers; (3) in the occurrence of geopolitical events, GPR could intensify cross-market risk spillovers in global financial markets, forming a risk spillover path with GPR as the risk transmitter and the gold market as the risk receiver. This study further analyzes risk spillover effects by considering risk asymmetry. The results show that risk spillovers from the GPR and global financial markets are significantly asymmetric and are dominated by risk spillovers that consider negative risk changes. These findings can help prevent cross-market risk spillovers among GPR and global financial markets and provide new ideas to counteract black swan events.","[Zheng, Jinlin; Shen, Yue] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian 710061, Peoples R China; [Wen, Baoyu] New Huadu Business Sch, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yaohui] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Business, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaohan] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Jinlin; Shen, Yue] 28 Xianning West Rd, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Wen, Baoyu] 200 Xiyuangong Rd, Fuzhou 350108, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yaohui] 100 Wudong Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaohan] 422,Siming South Rd, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Xiamen University,"Jiang, YH (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Business, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",jiangyh@163.sufe.edu.cn,,"Jiang, Yaohui/0000-0002-3271-6877",,,,,57,46,51,32,171,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0140-9883,1873-6181,,ENERG ECON,Energy Econ.,NOV,2023,127.0,,A,,,,,,107051.0,10.1016/j.eneco.2023.107051,0,,SEP 2023,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GZ9G3,,,,,2025-12-15,WOS:001156615300001,0,financialmarkets

This paper examines the influences of economic openness measured by trade openness and financial openness, on the development of financial markets in developed economies proxied by the Financial Market Index, a composite index representing the sum of financial market depth, access, and efficiency measurements. Yearly panel data from World Bank and International Monetary Fund for G10 countries spanning the period 2001-2019 and Autoregressive Distributed Lag model (panel-ARDL) are employed for analysis, and main results follow. Trade openness, financial openness, and economic growth are crucial determinants of financial market development in the long-run. However, in the short run, only financial openness has a positive and a significant impact on financial market development. The empirical results also reveal that Inflation has a detrimental effect on the evolution of the financial markets in the short and long term. The error correction term is negative in sign and statistically significant suggesting a long run equilibrium relationship amongst our variables, where, 28% of disequilibria in financial market development is corrected annually; a fairly high speed of adjustment that takes around 3.5 years to restore equilibrium. Finally, decision-makers should be attentive regarding the economic openness, and able to assess and manage trade and financial openness, keeping a growing rate of economic growth and low inflation rate, in order to promote the stability of the financial markets, and allow developed economies to exploit the benefits of economic openness for financial markets development.","[Alomari, Mohammad W.; Alyousef, Abdullah M.] Hashemite Univ, Econ Dept, Econ, Zarqa, Jordan; [Alomari, Mohammad W.] Dhofar Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Salalah, Oman; [Hailat, Mahmoud] Yarmouk Univ, Econ Dept, Econ, Irbid, Jordan; Dhofar Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Finance, Salalah, Oman",Hashemite University; Dhofar University; Yarmouk University; Dhofar University,"Alomari, MW (corresponding author), Hashemite Univ, Econ Dept, Econ, Zarqa, Jordan.;Alomari, MW (corresponding author), Dhofar Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Salalah, Oman.",mohammadw@hu.edu.jo; mahailat@yu.edu; abdullahm@hu.edu.jo; aalghazali@du.edu.om,"Alomari, Mohammad/V-2043-2019; AlGhazali, Abdullah/NCV-8795-2025","Alomari, Mohammad w/0000-0002-9750-6715; Alyousef, Abdullah/0009-0003-3324-8643;",,,,,31,1,1,0,3,ECONOMIC LABORATORY TRANSITION RESEARCH PODGORICA-ELIT,PODGORICA,"DZ VASINGTONA 4-5, PODGORICA, 00000, MONTENEGRO",1800-5845,1800-6698,,MONTENEGRIN J ECON,Montenegrin J.

By drawing analogies between the dynamics of financial markets and fluid turbulence, an innovative analytical framework has been developed to enhance our understanding of the complexity inherent in financial markets. The research methodology involves a comparative analysis of several national stock market indices and simulated turbulent velocity time series, with a particular focus on key statistical properties such as probability distributions, correlation structures, and power spectral densities. Furthermore, a financial market capital flow model has been established, and corresponding solutions have been proposed. Through computational simulations and data analysis, it was discovered that financial market volatility shares some statistical characteristics with turbulence, yet there are significant differences in the shape of probability distributions and the timescales of correlations. This indicates that although financial markets exhibit patterns similar to turbulence, as a multivariate-driven complex system, their behavioral patterns do not completely correspond to natural turbulence phenomena, highlighting the limitations of directly applying turbulence theory to financial market analysis. Additionally, the study explores the use of B & eacute;zier curves to simulate market volatility and, based on these analyses, formulates trading strategies that demonstrate practical applications in risk management. This research provides fresh perspectives for the fields of financial market theory and econophysics, offering new insights into the complexity of financial markets and the prevention and management of financial risks.","[Zheng, Haoran] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China; [Dong, Bo] East China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China",Shanghai University; East China Normal University,"Dong, B (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",haoranzheng@shu.edu.cn; 52264401003@stu.ecnu.edu.cn,"; Ferreira, Manuel Alberto M/N-3136-2013","zheng, haoran/0000-0001-7562-0640; Ferreira, Manuel Alberto M/0000-0002-4931-3281",,,,,30,1,1,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,Mathematics,MAY,2024,12.0,10.0,,,,,,,1416.0,10.3390/math12101416,0,,,28,Mathematics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics,SA0H4,,gold,,,2025-12-15,WOS:001231617600001,0,financialmarkets

The output shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively influenced the financial markets as indicated by sharply depreciating currency value around 10 % to 12 % and reducing short-position of futures derivatives around 3 % to 5 % for currency risk hedging. The robustness estimation shows that there have probabilistic distributed between Traded Futures Derivatives Contracts (TFDC), Currency Exchange Rate (CER), and Daily Covid Cases (DCC) and Daily Covid Deaths (DCD). Moreover, the output represents that the futures derivatives market conditionally depends on the currency market volatility given percentage of COVID-19 pandemic.

We observe that the forex and metal markets respond positively on event and post-event days. In contrast, the cryptocurrency market reacts negatively but generates positive abnormal returns, indicating that investors may seek refuge in these purported safe-havens. However, the energy market responded adversely to the event, and the trend continued in the aftermath. The study advocates the need for monitoring and minimizing financial contagion risk due to the increased interconnectedness of the financial markets. Our findings highlight the perilous consequences of the SVB collapse, as it triggered contagious effects that may spread throughout the global financial markets. Therefore, investors and financial institutions must diversify their portfolios across various asset classes, which can help mitigate the risks of such events.","[Naveed, Muhammad] Bahria Univ, Dept Management Studies, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ali, Shoaib] Lebanese Amer Univ, Adnan Kassar Sch Business, Beirut, Lebanon; [Ali, Shoaib] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Finance & Econ, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China; [Gubareva, Mariya] Univ Lisbon, ISEG Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal; [Gubareva, Mariya] Univ Lisbon, Res Ctr Econ & Org Sociol SOCIUS, Res Social Sci & Management CSG, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal; [Omri, Anis] Qassim Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Business Adm, POB 6640, Buraydah 51452, Qassim, Saudi Arabia",Bahria University; Lebanese American University; Jiangsu University; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Qassim University,"Gubareva, M (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, ISEG Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal.",mgubareva@iseg.ulisboa.pt,"; Omri, Anis/ABG-4274-2020; Ali, Shoaib/AAK-2396-2021; Naveed, Muhammad/Q-3417-2018; Gubareva, Mariya/Y-8520-2018","omri, Anis/0000-0003-3866-469X; Ali, Shoaib/0000-0001-5954-9987; Naveed, Muhammad/0000-0002-3288-8919;","FCT, I.P.; Portuguese National Funding Agency for Science, Research, and Technology [UIDB/04521/2020]","FCT, I.P.(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Portuguese National Funding Agency for Science, Research, and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This work was supported by FCT, I.P., the Portuguese National Funding Agency for Science, Research, and Technology, under Project UIDB/04521/2020.",,49,21,23,4,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0275-5319,1878-3384,,RES INT BUS FINANC,Res.

The results reveal that (1) the international crude oil market has a significant net risk spillover effect on China's financial markets; (2) the degree of spillover from the oil markets to the financial markets increases significantly under the shocks of extreme events; (3) the risk spillover effects of the oil markets on China's various financial sub-markets are heterogeneous, with a more significant spillover to the commodity, foreign exchange, and monetary markets and a less significant spillover to the bond and stock market; and (4) U.S. quantitative easing policy alleviates the risk spillover effects of the oil market to Chinese financial markets, while U.S. monetary policies surpassing the conventional level may increase the risk spillover in the early stage of a severe crisis.

The findings are as follows. First, we observe a steady growth of financial markets research in Africa over the 30-year period under consideration, which is suggestive of increasing interest and commitment to research on financial markets in Africa. Additionally, we note a lack of collaboration between or among researchers of financial markets studies in Africa, which implies very little knowledge exchange, ideas sharing, and innovations. We identify seven major areas of research based on the thematic network and content analysis, which are as follows: (i) asset pricing, (ii) financial integration, (iii) contagion, herding and extreme global events, (iv) efficiency and predictability of stock returns, (v) market interdependencies-sources and channels, (vi) portfolio diversification and risk management strategies, and (vii) impact of economic and financial news.

The findings confirm that motives to hold cash differ between developed and developing financial markets. The GMM findings further show that cash holdings (CH) in Australia are higher due to higher ratios of cash flow, research and development (R&D) and return on assets (ROA), and lower due to larger dividend payments. In the Malaysian market, however, cash flows and R&D are ineffectual, ROA falls and dividend payments rise CH.Practical implicationsThe study helps managers, practitioners and investors understand that firms' distinct economic, institutional, accounting and financial environments are important. To attain the desired outcomes, they must thus comprehend and consider these considerations while developing suitable liquidity strategies.Originality/valueTo the authors' best knowledge, this is the initial research demonstrating how varied cash motives and their ramifications are in developed and developing financial markets. Therefore, this study identifies the importance that CH motives varied among financial markets and that findings from a particular market cannot be generalised to other markets because of the market and financial structural variations.","[Akhtar, Tahir] Univ Hail, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ & Finance, Hail, Saudi Arabia",University Ha'il,"Akhtar, T (corresponding author), Univ Hail, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ & Finance, Hail, Saudi Arabia.",tahirakhtar01@gmail.com,"Akhtar, Tahir/JBJ-6550-2023","akhtar, tahir/0000-0003-2067-4021",,,,,129,7,9,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Leeds,"Floor 5, Northspring 21-23 Wellington Street, Leeds, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0368-492X,1758-7883,,KYBERNETES,Kybernetes,APR 5,2024,53.0,5.0,,,,,1653.0,1681.0,,10.1108/K-11-2022-1527,0,,FEB 2023,29,"Computer Science, Cybernetics",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,MW7S2,,,,,2025-12-15,WOS:000932677200001,0,financialmarkets

To this end, attempts have been made to both internationalize the Shanghai crude oil market and minimize financial risks. This paper selects three crude oil markets (INE, WTI and Brent) and five Chinese financial markets (the futures, bond, fund, stock and foreign exchange markets) as the research objects. The Diebold and Yilmaz spillover index model and the multifractal asymmetric detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-ADCCA) method are used to study the volatility spillover effect and the asymmetric cross-correlation between crude oil markets and financial markets. When the volatility spillover effect and the asymmetric relationship that exists between the financial markets are examined, the volatility spillover of the oil market to the financial market is found to be significantly higher than that of the financial market to the oil market. In particular, the spillover effect was even more significant from late-2019 to early-2020. Analysis demonstrates an asymmetric cross-correlation between crude oil markets and the abovementioned five Chinese financial markets. In particular, the impact of the Chinese crude oil market on the stock market is greatest, especially with respect to the Brent and WTI crude oil markets. Except for the bond market, when the INE and Brent markets are increasing, the risk exposure to financial markets is more significant. Among financial markets, INE-Bond market asymmetry is stronger than WTI-bond market asymmetry, but weaker than that of the Brent-Bond market when there are large fluctuations.","[Ling, Meijun; Cao, Guangxi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Cao, GX (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",caoguangxi@nuist.edu.cn,,"Ling, meijun/0000-0003-1099-8911",National Social Science Foundation of China [16ZDA054]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71701104],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We wish to thank the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 16ZDA054) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71701104) for their financial support towards this study.,,58,1,2,1,39,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0219-4775,1793-6780,,FLUCT NOISE LETT,Fluct.

The findings of wavelet multiple correlations indicate that the benefits of diversification opportunities are more evident in the short run. The evidence of wavelet multiple cross-correlations reveals that green bonds and financial markets are highly integrated in the long run. The results of the static connectedness framework explain that the direction and magnitude of spillover behave differently across markets. The world stock market is the net spillover transmitter, while the corporate bond market is the net spillover receiver among the selected markets. The green bond market is receiving more but transmitted less volatility in the present study. The evidence on dynamic connectedness measured by the rolling window approach shows that the interconnection between green bonds and financial markets is volatile over time. These pieces of evidence provide implications to global investors having a strong position in the green bonds market in terms of risk management and portfolio decisions.","[Elsayed, Ahmed H.] Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Elsayed, Ahmed H.] Zagazig Univ, Fac Commerce, Dept Econ, Zagazig, Egypt; [Naifar, Nader] Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIU, Coll Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Finance & Investment, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Naifar, Nader] Univ Sfax, Higher Inst Business Adm, Sfax, Tunisia; [Nasreen, Samia] Lahore Coll Women Univ, Dept Econ, Lahore, Pakistan; [Tiwari, Aviral Kumar] Indian Inst Management Bodh Gaya, Bodh Gaya, India",Durham University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Zagazig University; Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU); Universite de Sfax; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Bodh Gaya,"Elsayed, AH (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",ahmed.elsayed@durham.ac.uk; naneifar@imamu.edu.sa,"; Abd-Elhady, Ahmed/KHE-2817-2024; Naifar, Nader/AAJ-2859-2020; Tiwari, Aviral/C-5556-2011; Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/C-5556-2011; Nasreen, Samia/K-4205-2013","naifar, nader/0000-0001-9554-8236; Elsayed, Ahmed H/0000-0002-7506-5963; Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/0000-0002-1822-9263;",,,,,54,123,139,9,170,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0140-9883,1873-6181,,ENERG ECON,Energy Econ.,MAR,2022,107.0,,,,,,,,105842.0,10.1016/j.eneco.2022.105842,0,,JAN 2022,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,YX3TM,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",Y,N,2025-12-15,WOS:000754029500007,0,financialmarkets
