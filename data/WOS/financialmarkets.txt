We first construct a novel index of global climate policy uncertainty by performing textual analysis of two million news articles over the period 2013-2021. We then use a time-frequency spillover and network analysis to show how the impacts of shocks from global climate policy uncertainty on five key international financial markets evolve over time and to characterize the underlying risk transmission channels. We find significant spillovers from global climate policy uncertainty to the financial markets, while the impacts of global climate policy uncertainty are heterogenous across financial markets and more profound in the bond market. Our results also show that spillovers from global climate policy uncertainty to the financial markets are mostly concentrated in the short term, underscoring the need for investors to adjust strategies and regulators to implement measures mitigating short-term market reactions to climate policy shocks.

We also utilize the DCC-GARCH-t copula approach to examine the hedging effectiveness of the Australian sustainable and Islamic financial markets against the Australian conventional market's long-term volatility during high and low uncertainty. The time domain QVAR approach show that the Australian sustainable financial market returns receive the highest spillovers of shocks from TPU, FSI and GPR at the lower, medium and higher quantiles. Moreover, in the short term, at the lower quantiles the sustainable financial market receives the highest error variance contributions from FSI, while at higher quantiles, TPU, FSI and GPR transmit higher spillovers of shocks towards the sustainable market. Similarly, in the long term, the sustainable market receives the highest contributions to the error variances from TPU, FSI and GPR (GPR and TPU) at the lower (higher) quantiles. Moreover, at the lower, middle and higher quantiles, a shock in the Islamic (sustainable) market returns causes the highest contribution of error variances in the conventional market, compared with the (sustainable) Islamic market in the short and long run. Finally, the hedging strategy results show that investment in the Islamic financial market is the cheapest hedge against the long-term conventional market risk during high and low uncertainty periods.

Against the backdrop of financial globalization, the high volatility of cryptocurrency prices may pose a threat to the stability of the entire financial system. To explore the potential association and transmission of financial risks between cryptocurrency and traditional financial assets, this paper constructs a complex network using the Granger causality method and the DY spillover method. Based on data from 24 categories of assets or index returns from different markets, networks of association and risk spillover between cryptocurrency market and traditional financial markets are established under different time periods, the study covers the period from January 2015 to November 2023. Analyzing the mutual influence between cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets from the perspective of complex networks, and evaluating the market positioning, risk characteristics, and investment potential of cryptocurrency. Research findings indicate that cryptocurrency possesses not only monetary characteristics but also functions as an investment tool, significantly impacting the stability of traditional financial markets. Furthermore, different types of cryptocurrencies vary in market functions, risk characteristics, and investment potentials. Future research could further explore the nonlinear and dynamic associations between cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets, as well as the micro mechanisms and behavioral factors within cryptocurrency markets.

Global financial risk and market connectedness: An empirical analysis of COVOL and major financial markets	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Global financial risk; Dynamic connectedness; COVOL; Stock markets; Commodity markets; Volatility transmission; Financial crisis	IMPULSE-RESPONSE ANALYSIS; VOLATILITY SPILLOVERS; EQUITY MARKETS; STOCK-MARKET; OIL; CRISIS; CHINA; COMMODITIES; PRICES; GOLD	This study presents a novel investigation into the dynamic connectedness between the recently developed global risk measure, COVOL, created by Engle and Campos-Martins (2023), and the major international stock, gold, and crude oil markets in China, the US and Europe. Applying conditional and aggregated connectedness approaches, we systematically uncover the multi-dimensional interlinkages to understand volatility transmissions within these markets. Results reveal that COVOL predominantly receives volatility transmissions, with the US and European stock markets acting as principal transmitters of shocks across all three regional systems. The research also highlights the crucial role of significant events, such as the Global Financial Crisis, the Chinese stock market crash, and the COVID-19 pandemic, when increasing the intensity of connectedness. The volatility transmission of the COVOL-gold pairing is comparatively weaker than the COVOL-stock and COVOL-oil pairs. At the same time, the US and Europe consistently transmit stronger shocks to global financial risk, contributing significantly to the global risk transmission channel, whereas, in contrast, China's financial markets transmit less international uncertainty. Robustness testing verifies these findings.

The empirical results suggest that risk spillovers between them are strengthened in extreme market states and reduce the ability of the carbon market to be used for risk hedging in portfolios. Second, there is heterogeneity in the direction and size of spillovers between carbon and financial markets under bull and bear market conditions. This study also reveals that financial and carbon market participants pay more attention to risk information gathered from left-tail events. Finally, the paper identifies the transmitters and receivers of risk spillovers separately. The stock market is an important source of risks, authorities should pay attention to it.

INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & FINANCE			English	Article						CAViaR; Carbon markets; Cryptocurrencies; Green assets; TVP-VAR; Value -at -Risk	IMPULSE-RESPONSE ANALYSIS; BAD	The current controversies raised due to cryptocurrency mining and their hazardous impact on the environment have spurred the need of the current study to investigate whether green markets offset the risk of cryptocurrencies and carbon markets. We took five categories of financial markets, for instance, bonds, stocks, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and carbon markets to measure their tail risk at 5% value-at-risk (VaR). Moreover, we employed the novel technique of conditional autoregressive value-at-risk (CAViaR) along with time-varying parameters vector autoregressions (TVP-VAR) to indicate asymmetries among these financial markets. We found strong intra-class connectedness clusters with little interconnectedness among the markets. Subsequently, the time-varying trends highlighted extreme risk spillovers during the crisis times. Our findings offer valid justifications for policymakers, stakeholders, regulators, investors, and financial market participants.

However, the existing literature has relatively little empirical evidence on the risk spillover effects of GPR and multiple representative financial markets. Based on a time-varying frequency risk spillover network model, this paper examines the risk spillover effects across GPR and global stock markets, foreign exchange markets, bond markets, crude oil markets, and gold markets from both short-term and long-term perspectives. It found that (1) global foreign exchange and bond markets act as the center of global financial risk spillover networks, and GPR is more closely linked to crude oil markets; (2) the entire risk spillover network is mainly driven by short-term risk spillovers, but under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk spillover network is dominated by long-term risk spillovers; (3) in the occurrence of geopolitical events, GPR could intensify cross-market risk spillovers in global financial markets, forming a risk spillover path with GPR as the risk transmitter and the gold market as the risk receiver. This study further analyzes risk spillover effects by considering risk asymmetry. The results show that risk spillovers from the GPR and global financial markets are significantly asymmetric and are dominated by risk spillovers that consider negative risk changes. These findings can help prevent cross-market risk spillovers among GPR and global financial markets and provide new ideas to counteract black swan events.

By employing quantile vector autoregression model and conducting network analysis, this paper intends to reveal the dynamic relationship and the risk transmission mechanism between climate factors and various financial markets under different market conditions based on the data ranging from Nov.1, 2011 to December 31, 2021. We find that climate shocks intensify the risk contagion among China's financial markets, and the impact induced by each factor would present heterogeneity. The results also indicate that the systemic importance of climate shock index varies across market conditions. The findings shed light on the complex interaction between climate shocks and financial markets, which should contribute to policy implications for financial market stability and risk prevention.

Our results show that there is asymmetric risk transmission between cryptocurrencies and China's financial market, and the risk spillover effect is very weak. Specifically, the spillover of cryptocurrencies to China's financial market is significantly stronger than the spillover of China's financial market to cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies have a stronger spillover effect to China's exchange rate and gold. The net spillover effect of cryptocurrencies is weakening over time. Overall, the return spillover impact of cryptocurrencies on China's financial market is greater than the volatility spillover impact, and the degree of impact of different cryptocurrencies is heterogeneous. The findings of this study have several implications for policymakers and investors.

Bitcoin, ethereum, and binance responded significantly negatively, while equity, energy, and currency markets were largely unmoved. Gold and silver having significant positive returns suggests cryptocurrency investors fled to purported safe havens. Results are consistent with traditional investors already having evolved to indifference to cryptocurrencies during the bear market prior to the FTX collapse. Results also suggest that cryptocurrencies are likely not as important a concern to financial stability as previously regarded.

The impact of the SVB collapse on global financial markets: Substantial but narrow	FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Silicon Valley Bank; Bank run; Global financial markets; Event study; Contagion		We investigate the impact of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on global financial markets, identifying significant but narrow impacts. Abnormal returns are significant and negative for US equities, global banks, Bitcoin, as well as GCC equities. However, abnormal returns are insignificant for most fiat currencies, metals, and energy markets. That the SVB collapse had minimal effects on these markets suggests that the SVB event had a major but constrained effect on the global financial system, affecting significantly a small number of markets while largely ignoring others.

Using panel SGMM and Granger causality, it finds that financial inclusion fosters financial market growth, with stronger effects in robust macroeconomic environments. Financial inclusion positively or neutrally impacts banking and capital markets, amplified by sound macroeconomic factors. The findings highlight the importance of inclusive financial systems for advancing financial markets, influenced by national savings, trade, private capital flows, and regulatory quality.

In this paper, based on the members from Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), we measure the recovery speed of financial markets from banking crises by financial stress index (FSI). Then the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis methodology is applied to depict the stylized features of the recovery speed of financial markets. Further, the Cox proportional hazards model is introduced to investigate the effect of a variety of influencing factors on the recovery speed of financial markets from banking crises. The results indicate that certain factors, such as stationary macroeconomic environment, sound government finance, stable exchange rate regime, moderately open financial market, global financial market with high panic prior to banking crises, and expansionary monetary policy with the price rule after banking crises, contribute to fast recovery of financial markets.

An Evidence from G10 Group	MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS			English	Article						Financial Market Development; Trade Openness, Financial Openness; Panel ARDL, G10	TRADE OPENNESS; DETERMINANTS; INFLATION; IMPACT	The interactions between economic openness with other variables including inflation and GDP growth help to capture the different channels through which economic liberalization can benefit financial market development. This paper examines the influences of economic openness measured by trade openness and financial openness, on the development of financial markets in developed economies proxied by the Financial Market Index, a composite index representing the sum of financial market depth, access, and efficiency measurements. Yearly panel data from World Bank and International Monetary Fund for G10 countries spanning the period 2001-2019 and Autoregressive Distributed Lag model (panel-ARDL) are employed for analysis, and main results follow. Trade openness, financial openness, and economic growth are crucial determinants of financial market development in the long-run. However, in the short run, only financial openness has a positive and a significant impact on financial market development. The empirical results also reveal that Inflation has a detrimental effect on the evolution of the financial markets in the short and long term. The error correction term is negative in sign and statistically significant suggesting a long run equilibrium relationship amongst our variables, where, 28% of disequilibria in financial market development is corrected annually; a fairly high speed of adjustment that takes around 3.5 years to restore equilibrium. Finally, decision-makers should be attentive regarding the economic openness, and able to assess and manage trade and financial openness, keeping a growing rate of economic growth and low inflation rate, in order to promote the stability of the financial markets, and allow developed economies to exploit the benefits of economic openness for financial markets development.

J	Zheng, HR; Dong, B				Zheng, Haoran; Dong, Bo			Quantum Temporal Winds: Turbulence in Financial Markets	MATHEMATICS			English	Article						quantum finance; financial markets; turbulence; time series analysis		This paper leverages turbulence theory from physics to examine the similarities and differences between financial market volatility and turbulent phenomena on a statistical physics level. By drawing analogies between the dynamics of financial markets and fluid turbulence, an innovative analytical framework has been developed to enhance our understanding of the complexity inherent in financial markets. The research methodology involves a comparative analysis of several national stock market indices and simulated turbulent velocity time series, with a particular focus on key statistical properties such as probability distributions, correlation structures, and power spectral densities. Furthermore, a financial market capital flow model has been established, and corresponding solutions have been proposed. Through computational simulations and data analysis, it was discovered that financial market volatility shares some statistical characteristics with turbulence, yet there are significant differences in the shape of probability distributions and the timescales of correlations. This indicates that although financial markets exhibit patterns similar to turbulence, as a multivariate-driven complex system, their behavioral patterns do not completely correspond to natural turbulence phenomena, highlighting the limitations of directly applying turbulence theory to financial market analysis. Additionally, the study explores the use of B & eacute;zier curves to simulate market volatility and, based on these analyses, formulates trading strategies that demonstrate practical applications in risk management. This research provides fresh perspectives for the fields of financial market theory and econophysics, offering new insights into the complexity of financial markets and the prevention and management of financial risks.

We report significant symmetric (asymmetric) tail-dependent copulas in the upper (lower) tails characterizing independent regimes. Green bonds offer sufficient diversification, safe-haven, and hedging opportunities during stable and distressing times to financial markets. The extreme risk spillovers revealed that COVID-19 transformed the spillovers between green bonds and financial markets except Bitcoin.

The proper estimation effect of COVID-19 pandemic on dynamic emerging financial markets is a big challenge due to a complex multidimensional data. However, the present study proposes a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based multivariate regression approach with backpropagation algorithm and structural learning-based Bayesian network with constraint-based algorithm to investigate the influence of COVID-19 pandemic on the currency and derivatives markets of an emerging economy. The output shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively influenced the financial markets as indicated by sharply depreciating currency value around 10 % to 12 % and reducing short-position of futures derivatives around 3 % to 5 % for currency risk hedging. The robustness estimation shows that there have probabilistic distributed between Traded Futures Derivatives Contracts (TFDC), Currency Exchange Rate (CER), and Daily Covid Cases (DCC) and Daily Covid Deaths (DCD). Moreover, the output represents that the futures derivatives market conditionally depends on the currency market volatility given percentage of COVID-19 pandemic. This study may help to policymakers of financial markets in decision-making to control CER volatility that may promote currency market stability to enhance currency market activities and boost confidence of foreign investors in extreme financial crisis circumstances.

We observe that the forex and metal markets respond positively on event and post-event days. In contrast, the cryptocurrency market reacts negatively but generates positive abnormal returns, indicating that investors may seek refuge in these purported safe-havens. However, the energy market responded adversely to the event, and the trend continued in the aftermath. The study advocates the need for monitoring and minimizing financial contagion risk due to the increased interconnectedness of the financial markets. Our findings highlight the perilous consequences of the SVB collapse, as it triggered contagious effects that may spread throughout the global financial markets. Therefore, investors and financial institutions must diversify their portfolios across various asset classes, which can help mitigate the risks of such events.

J	Luo, CQ; Qu, Y; Su, YY; Dong, L				Luo, Changqing; Qu, Yi; Su, Yaya; Dong, Liang			Risk spillover from international crude oil markets to China's financial markets: Evidence from extreme events and US monetary policy	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE			English	Article						Risk spillovers; Extreme events; Higher -order moments; TVP-VAR; Quantitative easing	STOCK; VOLATILITY; PRICE; CONNECTEDNESS; GAS	We study the risk spillover from international crude oil markets to China's financial markets by considering the shocks from extreme events and the moderating effect of U.S. monetary policy. Using the data of international oil markets and China's financial markets from October 9, 2006, to March 8, 2022, we investigate the shocks of extreme events to risk spillover based on the GARCHSK-TVP-VAR-DY model with higher-order moments; we then empirically examine the moderating effect of the U.S. monetary policy (quantitative easing). The results reveal that (1) the international crude oil market has a significant net risk spillover effect on China's financial markets; (2) the degree of spillover from the oil markets to the financial markets increases significantly under the shocks of extreme events; (3) the risk spillover effects of the oil markets on China's various financial sub-markets are heterogeneous, with a more significant spillover to the commodity, foreign exchange, and monetary markets and a less significant spillover to the bond and stock market; and (4) U.S. quantitative easing policy alleviates the risk spillover effects of the oil market to Chinese financial markets, while U.S. monetary policies surpassing the conventional level may increase the risk spillover in the early stage of a severe crisis. Overall, this study has important implications for market participants and policymakers on spillover risk management.

The findings are as follows. First, we observe a steady growth of financial markets research in Africa over the 30-year period under consideration, which is suggestive of increasing interest and commitment to research on financial markets in Africa. Additionally, we note a lack of collaboration between or among researchers of financial markets studies in Africa, which implies very little knowledge exchange, ideas sharing, and innovations. We identify seven major areas of research based on the thematic network and content analysis, which are as follows: (i) asset pricing, (ii) financial integration, (iii) contagion, herding and extreme global events, (iv) efficiency and predictability of stock returns, (v) market interdependencies-sources and channels, (vi) portfolio diversification and risk management strategies, and (vii) impact of economic and financial news. We offer several avenues for future research that can set the agenda for financial market research in Africa in the coming years.

The findings confirm that motives to hold cash differ between developed and developing financial markets. The GMM findings further show that cash holdings (CH) in Australia are higher due to higher ratios of cash flow, research and development (R&D) and return on assets (ROA), and lower due to larger dividend payments. In the Malaysian market, however, cash flows and R&D are ineffectual, ROA falls and dividend payments rise CH.Practical implicationsThe study helps managers, practitioners and investors understand that firms' distinct economic, institutional, accounting and financial environments are important. To attain the desired outcomes, they must thus comprehend and consider these considerations while developing suitable liquidity strategies.Originality/valueTo the authors' best knowledge, this is the initial research demonstrating how varied cash motives and their ramifications are in developed and developing financial markets. Therefore, this study identifies the importance that CH motives varied among financial markets and that findings from a particular market cannot be generalised to other markets because of the market and financial structural variations.

J	Ling, MJ; Cao, GX				Ling, Meijun; Cao, Guangxi			Analysis of Risk Spillover and Asymmetry Between Three Crude Oil Markets and Chinese Financial Markets	FLUCTUATION AND NOISE LETTERS			English	Article						Crude oil market; financial markets; DY exponential model; asymmetric analysis	STOCK-MARKET; DYNAMIC SPILLOVER; PRICE SHOCKS; COMMODITY; VOLATILITY; IMPACT	Providing a scientific basis and method to ensure the smooth functioning of the Chinese crude oil market would be hugely significant to China's future economic development and security. To this end, attempts have been made to both internationalize the Shanghai crude oil market and minimize financial risks. This paper selects three crude oil markets (INE, WTI and Brent) and five Chinese financial markets (the futures, bond, fund, stock and foreign exchange markets) as the research objects. The Diebold and Yilmaz spillover index model and the multifractal asymmetric detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-ADCCA) method are used to study the volatility spillover effect and the asymmetric cross-correlation between crude oil markets and financial markets. When the volatility spillover effect and the asymmetric relationship that exists between the financial markets are examined, the volatility spillover of the oil market to the financial market is found to be significantly higher than that of the financial market to the oil market. In particular, the spillover effect was even more significant from late-2019 to early-2020. Analysis demonstrates an asymmetric cross-correlation between crude oil markets and the abovementioned five Chinese financial markets. In particular, the impact of the Chinese crude oil market on the stock market is greatest, especially with respect to the Brent and WTI crude oil markets. Except for the bond market, when the INE and Brent markets are increasing, the risk exposure to financial markets is more significant. Among financial markets, INE-Bond market asymmetry is stronger than WTI-bond market asymmetry, but weaker than that of the Brent-Bond market when there are large fluctuations.

Based on a Quantile Regression, we show that financial stress has highest predictive abilities at the lower quantiles when the market is bearish. Then, we propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based on the transition matrix to understand the relationship between financial stress index and the MENA stock market dynamics. We find that the effect of financial stress on stock market return reveals the persistence of regimes: Bullish state exists and persists, and has the longest conditional expected duration for the majority of MENA markets, except Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan. However, the transition probability from the bullish to the calm regime is too low for the financial market of Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Besides, the estimated mean returns for each regime divulge that the bearish and calm states are more attractive destination for both portfolio managers and investors.

The findings of wavelet multiple correlations indicate that the benefits of diversification opportunities are more evident in the short run. The evidence of wavelet multiple cross-correlations reveals that green bonds and financial markets are highly integrated in the long run. The results of the static connectedness framework explain that the direction and magnitude of spillover behave differently across markets. The world stock market is the net spillover transmitter, while the corporate bond market is the net spillover receiver among the selected markets. The green bond market is receiving more but transmitted less volatility in the present study. The evidence on dynamic connectedness measured by the rolling window approach shows that the interconnection between green bonds and financial markets is volatile over time. These pieces of evidence provide implications to global investors having a strong position in the green bonds market in terms of risk management and portfolio decisions.
