APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE			English	Article						Rabbit; Attachment; LAPS; Welfare; Husbandry conditions; Human -animal relationship	ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT; BEHAVIOR; WELFARE; DOG; STRESS; OWNER; ATTACHMENT; CARE; PERSONALITY; LONELINESS	Rabbits are becoming one of the most popular pets in western countries, including the Czech Republic. Until now, the welfare-husbandry conditions of rabbits in correlation with owner attachment to the rabbit has never been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the bond with a rabbit and selected factors, such as ownership of a dog and/or cat, the time spent with the rabbit, and the age of any children living in the household, have an impact on a pet rabbit's husbandry conditions. Data was gathered on the basis of a questionnaire survey conducted among pet rabbit owners in the Czech Republic. In total, 1651 completed questionnaires were collected through various channels, namely veterinary surgeries, pet shops, breeders, and social media. The questions covered demographics, living conditions, the presence of children and/or other pets, and the strength of the bond. We found that living with a child/children under 12 years of age, owning a dog and a cat, and spending less time with the rabbit were associated with a decreased bond between the owner and the rabbit. It was also found that decreased time spent with the rabbit is associated with decreased animal husbandry conditions. However, only a weak association was found between the bond of the owners to their rabbit and its welfare-husbandry conditions. Overall, the most alarming finding was that over 80% of companion rabbits in Czech Republic are kept in isolation. In conclusion, the amount of time owners spend with their rabbit appears to be a suitable parameter for determining the strength of the bond attachment and husbandry conditions of the rabbit. There were minimal differences between the strength of the bond and the breeding status of the rabbit if there was a child and/or other pets such as a dog and/or cat in the household. The role of rabbits has changed recently, and it is therefore necessary to conduct comprehensive research into rabbit welfare.

Both parasites shed environmentally robust environmental stages (oo/cysts) and have been responsible for numerous waterborne outbreaks of diseases. Cryptosporidium hominis and C. parvum are responsible for most infections in humans, while Giardia duodenalis assemblages A and B, cause most human cases of giardiasis. Cryptosporidium cuniculus, the dominant species infecting rabbits, is the only spceies other than C. hominis and C. parvum to have caused a waterborne outbreak of gastritis, which occurred in the United Kingdom in 2008. This review examines the prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia species in rabbits to better understand the public health risks of contamination of water sources with Cryptosporidium and Giardia oo/cysts from rabbits. Despite the abundance of C. cuniculus in rabbits, reports in humans are relatively rare, with the exception of the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and reports of C. cuniculus in humans from the United Kingdom have declined substantially since the 2008 outbreak. Subtyping of C. cuniculus has supported the potential for zoonotic transmission. Relatively few studies have been conducted on Giardia, but assemblage B dominates. However, improved typing methods are required to better understand the transmission dynamics of Giardia assemblages in rabbits. Similarly, it is not well understood if pet rabbits or contaminated water are the main source of C. cuniculus infections in humans. Well-planned studies using high-resolution typing tools are required to understand the transmission dynamics better and quantify the public health risk of Cryptosporidium and Giardia from rabbits.

The virus has a high mortality rate and can spread rapidly once introduced in a rabbit population. Vaccination against RHDV2 provides the best protection against disease and should be considered by all rabbit owners. Here, we investigate the duration of immunity provided by vaccination with the Medgene Platform conditionally licensed commercial vaccine 6 months following the initial series. Rabbits received either the vaccination or a placebo and were challenged with RHDV2 6 months later. All vaccinated rabbits survived challenge whereas 18/19 non-vaccinated controls succumbed to infection within 10 or fewer days post-challenge. These results demonstrate lasting immunity following vaccination with the Medgene RHDV2 vaccine.

At present, there are few reports on the establishment of rabbits' gut microbiota and its relationship with the host. To clarify the colonization of rabbits' gut microbiota, the changes in species during development, and the relationship between gut microbiota and rabbits' growth and development, this study determined the 16s rRNA of gut microbiota in rabbits of different age groups and preliminarily explored the changes in the types of gut microbiota during the colonization process. Six amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that significantly affect body weight were obtained. The research results provide a firm theoretical basis for maintaining gut health and constructing new methods for rabbit breeding. This study used feces from 0-day-old (36 rabbits), 10-day-old (119 rabbits), and 60-day-old (119 rabbits) offspring rabbits and their corresponding female rabbits (36 rabbits) as experimental materials. Using 16s rRNA sequencing, the study analyzed the types and changes of gut microbiota in rabbits at different growth and development stages, as well as the correlation between gut microbiota composition and the weight of 60-day-old rabbits. All experimental rabbits were placed in the same rabbit shed. Juvenile rabbits were fed solid feed at 18 days of age and weaned at 35 days of age. In addition to identifying the dominant bacterial phyla of gut microbiota in rabbits at different age stages, it was found that the abundance of Clostridium tertium and Clostridium paraputrificum in all suckling rabbits (10-day-old) was significantly higher than that in rabbits fed with whole feed (60-day-old) (p < 0.05), while the abundance of Gram-negative bacterium cTPY13 was significantly lower (p < 0.05). In addition, Fast Expected Maximum Microbial Source Tracing (FEAST) analysis showed that the contribution of female rabbits' gut microbiota to the colonization of offspring rabbits' gut microbiota was significantly higher than that of unrelated rabbits' gut microbiota (p < 0.05). The contribution of female rabbits' gut microbiota to the colonization of gut microbiota in 0-day-old rabbits was significantly higher than that to the colonization of gut microbiota in the 10- and 60-day-old rabbits (p < 0.05). Finally, the correlation between gut microbiota composition and body weight of 60-day-old rabbits was analyzed based on a mixed linear model, and six ASVs significantly affecting body weight were screened. The above results provide important theoretical and practical guidance for maintaining gut health, improving growth and development performance, and feeding formulation in rabbits.

However, how the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) adapts to different predator pressure is not fully known. Here, we studied the adaptive anti-predatory responses of European rabbits exposed to different terrestrial predation pressure. To do this, we took advantage of a rabbit translocation programme in the Sierra Norte Natural Park of Sevilla (SW Spain), where rabbits from the same donor population were translocated in plots with and without terrestrial predator exclusion fences (aerial predation was not excluded in any of the plots). This presented an ideal opportunity to observe whether the behaviour of individuals from the same population adapts to situations with different predator pressure; thus, their behaviour was evaluated through direct observations. Although most rabbits were observed close to cover, differences in distance to cover, group size and behaviour were observed between fenced and unfenced plots. Overall, both adult and juvenile rabbits moved further from cover in the unfenced plot than in the fenced plot. Most of the observations in the unfenced plot corresponded to rabbits in pairs or alone; whereas in the fenced plot, rabbits were primarily in pairs or in larger groups. Our findings suggest that in the unfenced plot, rabbits that moved further from cover were often part of larger groups (>= 4 rabbits); whereas in the fenced plot, it was rabbits in smaller groups (< 4 rabbits). Rabbits in the unfenced plot were alert and running more frequently than rabbits in the fenced one; in the latter, these rabbits were mostly feeding. Other relaxed behaviours such us grooming or resting were more frequent close to cover. In summary, our results highlight rabbits' capacity to promptly adjust behaviour in response to predation risk, exhibiting adaptive anti-predatory responses tailored to different predation pressures. These insights contribute to understanding the nuanced dynamics of prey species' responses to diverse predation scenarios.

ANIMALS Cases of gastrointestinal obstruction in rabbits (n = 56, including 64 events) that had presented to a veterinary teaching hospital from 2012 to 2021. METHODS This was a retrospective study in which data on rabbits with evidence of gastrointestinal obstruction were extracted from veterinary teaching hospital medical records over a 9-year period. Systemic lidocaine treatment, breed, sex, age, temperature at presentation, blood glucose at presentation, and time to discharge or death were evaluated with univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify factors significantly associated with survival to hospital discharge in rabbits with gastrointestinal obstruction. RESULTS Comparatively, 89.7% of rabbits treated with lidocaine CRI (n = 39) survived to hospital discharge, while only 56% of rabbits that were not treated with lidocaine CRI (25) survived. In the final multivariate analysis, 2 factors were associated with survival to discharge: rabbits treated with systemic lidocaine and male rabbits had increased odds of survival compared to those not treated with systemic lidocaine and female rabbits, respectively.

"The 21st Century Rabbit Paradox" Attitudes Toward and Experiences with Rabbits in the United States	SOCIETY & ANIMALS			English	Article						animal attitudes; human -animal interactions; rabbits; urban -rural differences	ANIMALS; CATS; PET; PERCEPTIONS; DISSECTION	The unique relationship humans have with rabbits has been coined the "21st century rabbit paradox" because there are few social boundaries surrounding how rabbits are interacted with and used by humans. Though this paradoxical relationship with rabbits has been observed, there is no clear empirical picture of what it looks like. This online survey of 1,OO6 US adults is the first to measure the prevalence and nature of human interactions with and attitudes toward rabbits across multiple industries. This study finds that experiences with rabbits are quite often nonexistent, the types of experiences respondents have had with rabbits vary widely, and many respondents lacked opinions regarding how rabbits are used by humans. The findings provide a clear picture of just how paradoxical the human relationship with rabbits is in US society and suggests areas for future research.

This study aimed to examine how past and current experiences, reasons for acquiring rabbits, and methods of knowledge acquisition impact the lifestyle and health of pet rabbits in households. Among 306 rabbit owners surveyed, 25% had previous experience with rabbits, and 54% had owned rabbits for over 3 years. While 61% sought veterinary care upon acquiring rabbits, only 47% scheduled regular check-ups, and 38% consulted a veterinarian when health changes were noticed. Sixty-nine percent of rabbits were primarily fed hay, and just 23% were provided companionship with other rabbits. Reasons for acquiring rabbits included gifts (17%) and seeking companionship (43%). Only 18% of respondents obtained information about rabbit care from veterinarians.

As a crucial economic animal, rabbit has been successfully bred into wool-use, meat-use and fur-use breeds. Hair length is one of the most economically important traits affecting profitability in wool rabbits. In this study, to identify selection signatures with the long-hair trait, whole-genomic resequencing of long-haired rabbits (Angora rabbits) and short-haired rabbits (Rex and New Zealand rabbits) was performed.ResultsBy genome-wide selective sweeping analysis based on population comparison, we identified a total of 5.85 Mb regions (containing 174 candidate genes) with strong selection signals. Six of these genes (Dusp1, Ihh, Fam134a, Map3k1, Spata16, and Fgf5) were enriched in the MAPK signalling and Hedgehog signalling pathways, both of which are closely associated with hair growth regulation. Among these genes, Fgf5 encodes the FGF5 protein, which is a well-established regulator of hair growth. There was a nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution (T19234C) in the Fgf5 gene. At this locus, the C allele was present in all of the tested Angora rabbits, while the T allele was dominant in New Zealand and Rex rabbits. We further confirmed that the C allele was conserved in Angora rabbits by screening an additional 135 rabbits. Moreover, the results of functional predictions and co-immunoprecipitation revealed that the T19234C mutation impaired the binding capacity of FGF5 to its receptor FGFR1.ConclusionsWe discovered that the homozygous missense mutation T19234C within Fgf5 might contribute to the long-hair trait of Angora rabbits by reducing its receptor binding capacity. This finding will provide new insights into the genetic basis underlying the genetic improvement of Angora rabbits and benefit the improvement of rabbit breeding in the future.

Comparison of the effects of probiotic-based formulations on growth, feed utilization, blood constituents, cecal fermentation, and duodenal morphology of rabbits reared under hot environmental conditions	ANNALS OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						rabbit; probiotic; hot climate; growth; volatile fatty acids; blood	ENTEROCOCCUS-FAECIUM; LACTOBACILLUS-PLANTARUM; CLOSTRIDIUM-BUTYRICUM; INTESTINAL MICROFLORA; FATTY-ACIDS; PERFORMANCE; HISTOMORPHOLOGY; CHOLESTEROL; MICROBIOTA; ORIGIN	The present study aimed to assess the effects of three probiotic-supplemented diets on growth, cecal fermentation, blood biochemical, and intestinal morphological features in growing rabbits reared under summer conditions. Rabbits were allotted into four groups: G1 rabbits were fed the basal diet (control), G2 rabbits received Enterococcus faecium (EF) and Clostridium butyricum (CB) complexes (1 x 10(8) and 2.5 x 10(6) cfu/kg diet, respectively), G3 rabbits were given CB (2.5 x 10(6) cfu/kg diet) and yeast complexes (1 g/kg diet), and G4 rabbits received EF (2 x 10(8) cfu/kg diet) and yeast (1 g/kg diet). G2 rabbits exhibited the highest performances in terms of enhanced body weight and weight gain, protein efficiency ratio and feed conversion ratio (P < 0.05). Serum total protein, globulin, immunoglobulin M, and high-density lipoprotein concentrations were higher in probiotic-fed rabbits than those in controls. Additionally, lipid profile parameters were significantly reduced in the probiotic-fed rabbits, with the lowest concentrations measured in G4 rabbits (P < 0.05). Rabbits given EF and CB had the highest total volatile fatty acid (VFA) and propionic acid levels and the lowest ammonia concentrations. Increased villi length and muscular layer thickness and reduced crypt depth were observed in rabbits receiving EF and CB compared with the values obtained in controls (P < 0.05). In summary, supplementing fattening rabbit diets with EF and CB, as a novel formulation, might be a promising and easy method to enhance growth performance under hot climate conditions by improving the feed utilization, immune response, serum lipid profile, cecal VFA production, and duodenal morphology.

Factors, such as human-directed aggression and friendliness, are important from the aspect of animal welfare and owner satisfaction. In an online questionnaire for Hungarian pet rabbit owners (N = 1039 entries), we targeted the interactions between rabbits and their owners as well as interactions with strangers. The sex, reproductive status, breed, origin, keeping conditions of the rabbit, diet, and the owners' knowledge about sensitive period treatment, were asked in the questionnaire. Principal Component Analysis yielded three behavioral dimensions (explaining the 63.5% of total variance) - which, based on the encompassed items, were named 'Amicable', 'Aggression towards strangers' and 'Aggression towards the owner'. In the next step we looked for significant associations between the three behavioral components and the aforementioned fixed factors. We found that 'Amicable' had higher scores in the case of male rabbits (vs. females, P < 0.001), intact rabbits (vs. spayed/neutered, P < 0.05), and dwarf pet rabbit breeds (vs. large traditional meat rabbits, P < 0.001). Low 'Amicable' scores were given to rabbits that were adopted from shelters (P < 0.01), and also to those that were never let out from their cages/pens (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the owners who knew about the importance of the early socialization period, had the most 'Amicable' rabbits (P < 0.05). Finally, individually kept rabbits and those that received the longest time of maternal care (kept with the mother even after weaning), were considered as more 'Amicable' than those rabbits that had other rabbit companions (P < 0.05); or were separated from their mother before normal weaning time (P < 0.05). We found similarly detailed results regarding the associations between the independent variables and the two 'Aggression' components. We also found more unique associations, for example between the type of food and aggressiveness; rabbits fed with muesli-type feed reportedly behaved more aggressively with humans (P < 0.05) than those that were fed mainly pellets with additional hay. Understandably, there are also limitations as we could not establish causality from these results and also the distribution of the subjects among the various categories was sometimes far from balanced, which may lessen the representativity of the results in particular cases.

Ear health and quality of life in pet rabbits of differing ear conformations: A UK survey of owner-reported signalment risk factors and effects on rabbit welfare and behaviour	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HEARING IMPAIRMENT; OTITIS-MEDIA; QUESTIONNAIRE; DOGS; HUSBANDRY; DISEASE; AGE	The impacts of ear disease on animal welfare and behaviour are little documented. Ear disease may be common in rabbits, but difficult to recognise, and lop-ears have previously been indicated as a risk factor for ear disease. We aimed to better understand the range of ear conditions in pet rabbits, signalment risk factors, and impacts on welfare and behaviour. Through an online questionnaire, we investigated owner-reported signalment, veterinary diagnosis of ear conditions, impaired hearing, and ear pain for UK pet rabbits. Relationships between ear condition measures and ear conformation, quality of life, and behaviour were analysed using logistic regression. Of 551 valid responses, 28.5% of rabbits reportedly had experienced ear conditions; 21.2% diagnosed or mentioned by vets, with otitis and excess cerumen most common. Approximately 25% of lop-eared rabbits had ear conditions indicated by a vet versus 10% of erect-eared rabbits. Lop-eared, half-lop, and older rabbits were most at risk (P<0.050). Rabbits reported as showing ear pain responses had reduced owner-reported quality of life compared with other rabbits (P<0.050). Rabbits with ear problems were less likely to be responsive to relevant sounds, and performed binky behaviour (joy jumps) less frequently, than rabbits without such issues. Understanding prevalence and risk factors for ear conditions is critical to improving welfare standards across this widely owned pet species. The findings suggest that improved recognition and treatment of ear conditions, and avoiding breeding from rabbits with early signs, or a family history, of ear disease are necessary to help combat this animal welfare issue.

However, little is known about the rate at which this evolutionary change occurred. We collated data from challenge trials that estimated rabbit resistance to myxomatosis in Australia and expressed resistance on a continuous scale, enabling trends in its development to be assessed over 45 years up to 1995. Resistance initially increased rapidly, followed by a plateau lasting ten years, before a second rapid increase occurred associated with the introduction of European rabbit fleas as myxoma virus vectors. By contrast, in the United Kingdom, where rabbit flea vectors were already present when the myxoma virus initially spread, resistance developed more slowly. No estimates of rabbit resistance to myxomatosis have been made for almost 30 years, despite other highly lethal rabbit pathogens becoming established worldwide. Continued testing of wild-caught rabbits in Australia to determine current levels of resistance to myxomatosis is recommended to assess its current effectiveness for managing pest rabbits. Given the economic and environmental significance of invasive rabbits, it would be remiss to manage such biological resources and ecosystem services poorly.

Poultry and rabbit production has recently experienced many challenges, including climate change, disease spread, and antibiotic misuse. Bee products have emerged as promising natural alternatives to antibiotics due to their nutritional and therapeutic properties. This review aims to present an overview of the possible advantages of using different bee products, separately or combined, in poultry and rabbit farms. The results indicate that bee products can positively affect poultry and rabbit's physiological traits, production, reproduction, health/immunity, and product quality. Therefore, bee products have great potential as a safe and effective addition to poultry and rabbit production.Abstract Poultry and rabbit production are important and rapidly growing agricultural subsectors, particularly in several developing countries. To ensure the sustainability of poultry and rabbit production, realistic poultry and rabbit farming practices must be improved. Apitherapy is a traditional alternative medicine that involves the prevention and treatment of some diseases with several bee products including propolis, royal jelly, pollen, and venom. More feeding investigations on the numerous benefits of bee products for poultry and rabbits are crucial to be addressed. Poultry and rabbit production has recently experienced numerous challenges, including climate change, disease spread, and antibiotic misuse. Improving animal welfare, health, and production is a top priority for all livestock farms, as is supplying consumers with safe and healthy products. Therefore, this review aims to collect and investigate recent relevant literature on the use of bee products, as feed additives, drinking water supplements, and injections, for poultry and rabbits to improve animal health and production. From the current findings, bee products can improve the growth and immunological performance of small-livestock animals, such as poultry and rabbits, by activating digestive enzymes, maintaining microbial balance, and promoting vitamin synthesis. Therefore, bee products could be a promising natural alternative to growth promoters, reproductive stimulants, and immunological enhancers in poultry and rabbit farms to provide safe and healthy products for humans.

The Effect of Exogenous Lysozyme Supplementation on Growth Performance, Caecal Fermentation and Microbiota, and Blood Constituents in Growing Rabbits	ANIMALS			English	Article						growth performance; nutrient digestibility; volatile fatty acids; caecal microbiota; antioxidant status; rabbit	VOLATILE FATTY-ACIDS; INTESTINAL MORPHOLOGY; GUT MICROBIOTA; DIETARY FIBER; DIGESTIBILITY; EXPRESSION; DIGESTION; PATTERN; TRAITS; STRESS	Simple Summary Rabbit farming is increasingly requiring non-antibiotic alternatives to improve rabbit gut health to maintain high feeding efficiency and excellent production index. Thus, using a friendly alternative is an appropriate way to protect rabbits from pathogens while also enhancing their performance and welfare. Lysozyme, an enzyme derived from avian egg white, aids in nutrient digestion and absorption and provides protection against bacterial diseases while lowering pollutants' excretion, such as ammonia. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of lysozyme supplementation in rabbits' diets on growth performance, caecal fermentation, bacteria population, and blood constituents. The results demonstrated an improvement in rabbit performance, caecal fermentation, blood lipid profile, and antioxidant status due to an increase in beneficial bacteria in lysozyme-treated rabbits. Therefore, supplementing the rabbit diet with lysozyme up to 150 mg/kg is recommended. The effects of exogenous lysozyme supplementation (LYZ) on growth performance, caecal fermentation and microbiota, and blood characteristics were investigated in growing rabbits. A total of 420 growing male V-Line rabbits (30 d old; weighing 528 +/- 16 g) were randomly divided into four groups of 105 rabbits each, and monitored for 42 days. Experimental groups included a control group (LYZ0) fed a basal diet without LYZ supplementation, and three treated groups fed the same basal diet supplemented with LYZ at 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg diet, respectively. The results showed a quadratic improvement in the final body weight, daily growth rate, FCR, and digestibility of DM, while the digestibility of OM, CP, EE, NDF, and ADF improved linearly when LYZ supplementation was increased. The dressing percentage increased quadratically when LYZ levels were increased in the rabbit diets. In rabbits fed LYZ diets, L. acidophilus counts increased linearly (p < 0.05) and L. cellobiosus, and Enterococcus sp. counts increased quadratically, whereas E. coli counts decreased. In the LYZ-supplemented groups, the caecal pH value and NH3-N concentration declined quadratically, whereas total VFA, acetic, and butyric acids increased. Total lipids decreased linearly, whilst triglycerides and cholesterol decreased quadratically with LYZ supplementation. Total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, and catalase increased quadratically, while malondialdehyde decreased linearly in the LYZ-supplemented groups. In conclusion, exogenous lysozyme administration improved rabbit growth performance and antioxidant status while lowering the blood lipid profile, altering the bacterial population, and regulating caecal fermentation. Therefore, LYZ up to 150 mg/kg can be used as a potential supplement in rabbit feed.

Environmental enrichment (EE) could reduce stress in farm animals; however, limited information is available on the microbial community composition in rabbits raised with or without EE. This study aimed to identify EE influences on the behavior, serum hormonal levels, and cecal microbiota of rabbits. Two hundred Rex rabbits were segregated randomly within four cohorts (n = 50); reared for 76 d within standardized enclosures (non enriched) or within cages containing a willow-stick (WS), rubber-duck (RD), or a can of beans (CB). The rabbits' ingestive, rest, locomotion, exploratory, grooming, and abnormal behavior were observed. The serum hormone levels for rabbits were measured, and cecal specimens were sequencedfrom the V3-V4 region using 16S rRNA amplicons. Environmental enrichment increased feeding and drinking time, promoted exploratory behavior, and reduced abnormal behavior in rabbits. Insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1) levels of the enriched cohorts were elevated in comparison to the control cohort. Serum cortisol level for CB cohort was markedly reduced in comparison to the control cohort (p < 0.05), while dopamine levels for CB cohort peaked. Further, we found that EE mainly affected the dominant microbiota. Several families, such as Erysipelotrichaceae, Tannerellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Burkholderiaceae, and Prevotellaceae were markedly reduced within the CB cohort. Bacteria such as Alloprevotella, Bifidobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, Parabacteroides, and Erysipelatoclostridium were identified as having negative associations with the presence of serum cortisol. EE influenced rabbit behavior and serum hormonal levels, and CB enrichment was the most suitable for rabbits. Further, cecal microbiota composition and diversity were affected by CB enrichment. These findings suggested that CB could be considered for use in rabbit husbandry.

Among the main factors influencing the characteristics of rabbit meat proteins to appertain the breed, genotype, carcass part and age. Conventional production of rabbit meat in many European countries is mainly ensured by intensive production systems, when commercial meat-type albinotic rabbit crossbreds are used. However, spotted and solidly coloured lines of meat rabbit breeds have begun to be used in rabbit breeding schemes as some consumers have begun to negatively perceive meat from albinotic coloured rabbits. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of the sire genotype, sex and carcass part on the composition of meats of rabbits fattened under conditions where no synthetic drugs were used. Crossbreeding of Mecklenburger Schecke sires with a commercial dam line of HYLA rabbits resulted in a worse nutritional quality of meat proteins in progeny. These findings point to a possible risk of alterations in the nutritional quality of meat proteins when using different rabbit sire genotypes than those originally intended for the specific commercial crossbreeding scheme. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of the sire genotype, sex and carcass part on the composition of the meat of rabbits, which were fattened under conditions where no synthetic drugs were used. As for carcass parts, the higher content of both total amino acids (AA) and all essential AA (EAA) monitored was found in the Longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscle as compared to hind leg meat (p < 0.001). Significant effects of the rabbit sire genotype and the genotype x sex interaction on proportions of some AA in meat were found (p < 0.001). Crossbreeding of the Mecklenburger Schecke (MS) sires with a commercial dam line of HYLA rabbits resulted in a lower proportion of the total AA and all EAA monitored in meats of MS sired males as compared to MS sired females and HYLA rabbits (p < 0.05). The sex-related effect on AA profile was not so noticeable in final commercial crossbreds of HYLA rabbits when compared to MS sired progeny. These findings point to a possible risk of alterations in the nutritional quality of meat proteins when using different rabbit sire genotypes than those originally intended for the specific commercial crossbreeding scheme. However, on the contrary, higher contents of magnesium (p < 0.05), manganese (p < 0.001) and zinc (p < 0.05) were found in meats of MS sired progeny as compared to HYLA rabbits.

Modulatory Impacts of Multi-Strain Probiotics on Rabbits' Growth, Nutrient Transporters, Tight Junctions and Immune System to Fight against Listeria monocytogenes Infection	ANIMALS			English	Article						multi-strain probiotics; cytokines; intestinal barrier; growth; L; monocytogenes; rabbits	LACTIC-ACID BACTERIA; ENTEROTOXIGENIC ESCHERICHIA-COLI; INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA; IN-VITRO; LACTOBACILLUS-ACIDOPHILUS; GLUCOSE-ABSORPTION; CECAL MICROFLORA; GENE-EXPRESSION; GUT MICROBIOTA; MEAT-PRODUCTS	Simple Summary Weaning is a crucial period associated with great stress and susceptibility to infection, implying adverse impacts on farmed rabbits' production. Recently, probiotics have been provided as direct microbial feed supplements, which are considered the ideal antibiotic substitutes during pathogenic infections with an emphasis on promoting rabbits' growth and modulating their immune functions. Therefore, our experiment was carried out to explore the efficacy of multi-strain probiotics (MSP) on rabbits' growth, molecular aspects, such as nutrients transporters, cytokines, and intestinal integrity, and effectiveness against Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) infection. Altogether, our findings proposed the beneficial consequences of MSP on rabbits' growth, gut health, and immunity. After post-experimental infection of rabbits with L. monocytogenes, administration of MSP during the whole rearing period greatly reduced the detrimental impact of infection and consequently renovated efficient rabbits' production. Multi-strain probiotics (MSP) are considered innovative antibiotics' substitutes supporting superior gut health and immunity of farmed rabbits. The promising roles of MSP on performance, intestinal immunity, integrity and transporters, and resistance against Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) were evaluated. In the feeding trial, 220 rabbits were fed a control diet or diet supplemented with three MSP graded levels. At 60 days of age, rabbits were experimentally infected with L. monocytogenes and the positive control, enrofloxacin, prophylactic MSP (MSPP), and prophylactic and therapeutic MSP (MSPTT) groups were included. During the growing period, MSP at the level of 1 x 10(8) CFU/kg diet (MSPIII) promoted the rabbits' growth, upregulated the nutrient transporters and tight-junction-related genes, and modified cytokines expression. Supplementing MSPTT for L. monocytogenes experimentally-infected rabbits restored the impaired growth and intestinal barriers, reduced clinical signs of severity and mortalities, and attenuated the excessive inflammatory reactions. Notably, enrofloxacin decreased L. monocytogenes and beneficial microbial loads; unlike MSPTT, which decreased pathogenic bacterial loads and sustained the beneficial ones. Histopathological changes were greatly reduced in MSPTT, confirming its promising role in restricting L. monocytogenes translocation to different organs. Therefore, our results suggest the use of MSPTT as an alternative to antibiotics, thereby conferring protection for rabbits against L. monocytogenes infection.

Influences of dietary herbal blend and feed restriction on growth, carcass characteristics and gut microbiota of growing rabbits	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Ccarcass; feed restriction; growing rabbits; herbs; microbiota; performance	PLANT-EXTRACTS; ESSENTIAL OILS; BENEFICIAL IMPACTS; THYMUS-VULGARIS; BLOOD INDEXES; ANTIBACTERIAL; QUALITY; SUPPLEMENTATION; PERFORMANCE; POWDER	The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of feed restriction systems, herbal mixture and their interactions on growth performance, carcass traits, and microbial aspects of growing New Zealand White (NZW) rabbit kept from 5 to 13 weeks of age. A 3 x 4 factorial arrangement was performed, including three feed restriction systems (ad-libitum, 90%, and 80% of ad-libitum) and four dietary supplementation levels of herbal mix (0, 0.30%, 0.50% and 0.70%). A total number of 120 rabbits (male and female ratio 1:1) at five weeks of age were randomly allotted into twelve experimental groups (n = 10 each). Results showed a significant decrease in body weight, body weight gain and feed intake in restricted-fed rabbits compared to the control group (ad-libitum). HERBS levels significantly influenced the growth performance and carcass traits of rabbits. The herbal blend had a positive effect on reducing the population of pathogenic microorganisms and increasing the population of lactic acid bacteria. Conclusively, it could be concluded that the feed restriction system has beneficial effects in the improvement of feed conversion ratio (FCR), weight gain, and carcass traits. In addition, HERBS supplementation to the growing rabbits resulted in significant improvements in growth performance, carcass characteristics, and microbial aspects of rabbits kept from 5 to 13 weeks of age.

Age differential response to bevacizumab therapy in choroidal neovascularization in rabbits	EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH			English	Article						Anti-VEGF resistance; Choroidal neovascularization; Persistent disease activity; Photoacoustic microscopy; OCT; Age-related macular degeneration; Contrast agents; Gold nanoparticles; Fluorescein angiography	OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; MACULAR DEGENERATION; ANIMAL-MODEL; PHOTOACOUSTIC MICROSCOPY; LAGOMORPHA; IMPAIRMENT; PREVALENCE; BLINDNESS; RETINA; EYE	Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in young rabbits has been shown to have a rapid, robust response after treatment with bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medication. This investigation evaluates an age differential response to bevacizumab in older populations of rabbits using multimodal high resolution molecular imaging. Young (4 months old) and life span (14 months old) rabbits were given subretinal injections of Matrigel and VEGF to produce CNV. All CNV rabbit models were then treated with a bevacizumab intravitreal injection. Rabbits were then monitored longitudinally using photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), op-tical coherence tomography (OCT), color photography, and fluorescence imaging. Chain-like gold nanoparticle clusters (CGNP) conjugated with tripeptide arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) was injected intravenously for molecular imaging. Robust CNV developed in both young and old rabbits. After intravitreal bevacizumab in-jection, fluorescence signals were markedly decreased 90.13% in the young group. In contrast, old rabbit CNV area decreased by only 10.56% post-bevacizumab treatment. OCT images confirmed a rapid decrease of CNV in the young group. CGNPs demonstrated high PAM signal in old rabbits and minimal PAM signal in young rabbits after bevacizumab, indicating CNV regression. There is a significant difference in response to intravitreal bev-acizumab treatment between young and old rabbits with CNV which can be monitored with multimodal mo-lecular imaging. Old rabbits demonstrate significant persistent disease activity. This represents the first large eye model of persistent disease activity of CNV and could serve as the foundation for future investigations into the mechanism of persistent disease activity and the development of novel therapies.

Fluralaner, an isoxazoline class of oral ectoparasiticide, is considered as a very potent acaricide. The present study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of oral fluralaner in pet rabbits with severe spontaneous Sarcoptes scabiei infestation. A total of eight un-neutered pet rabbits, tested positive for S. scabiei by microscopy of skin scrapings, were enrolled. Seven rabbits had severe clinical infestation (score 5), while remaining one rabbit had moderate disease clinical signs (score <3). A single oral dose equivalent to 25 mg/kg of fluralaner was administered to each rabbit. On day 14 post-therapy, marked improvements in the skin lesions were observed; severely infested rabbits had a clinical score of 3, while the moderately infested rabbit had a score of 1. However, none of the rabbits tested negative for S. scabiei. On day 30 post-therapy, complete clinical recovery was recorded in all rabbits (Score 0), but, a complete parasitological clearance was not recorded except to the moderately infested rabbit. All rabbits were tested negative for S. scabiei on day 45 post-therapy. Therefore, a single oral dose of fluralaner at a 25 mg/kg was found to be effective in the treatment of severe sarcoptic mange in pet rabbits and no additional topical or systemic medications were needed. Further studies in a larger number of individuals with a bigger spectrum of disease severities (i.e. more moderate/mild) are needed to comprehensively document the safety and efficacy of this drug in mangy rabbits.

Evaluating Pain and Analgesia Effectiveness Following Routine Castration in Rabbits Using Behavior and Facial Expressions	FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						rabbit; pain; behavior; analgesia; rabbit grimace scale	IMPUTATION; BUPRENORPHINE; RESPONSES; MELOXICAM; SOFTWARE; DOGS	Prevention of pain in rabbits is a priority for both welfare and validity of scientific data. We aimed to determine if the rabbit grimace scale (RbtGS) could be used as a viable, rapid assessment tool in two breeds of rabbit, Dutch belted (DB) and New Zealand white (NZW), following orchidectomy, as an adjunct to behavioral analysis. All animals received analgesia. Rabbits were filmed and their behavior was recorded at multiple time points pre- and post-orchidectomy. Observers then scored specific pain associated behaviors for analysis. Time matched footage was also scored using the rabbit grimace scale (RbtGS). Following surgery, rabbits showed significant increases in the duration spent displaying key pain associated behaviors at 1 and 5 h post-surgery. DB rabbits that received low dose meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg) showed significantly more pain behaviors at 1 and 5 h post-surgery compared to those administered a combination of higher dose meloxicam (0.6 mg/kg) and a lidocaine/bupivacaine local infusion. DB rabbits showed an increase in RbtGS score at both 1 and 5 h post-surgery. In the NZW rabbits, an increase in RbtGS score was only observed at 1 h post-surgery. Using behavioral analysis as the gold standard for comparison, the RbtGS was an effective means of determining when rabbits are painful following orchidectomy. Higher dose meloxicam (0.6 mg/kg) combined with local anesthetic was a more effective method of reducing pain, compared to lower dose meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg) alone.

Methods: A total of 90 growing rabbits aged 6 weeks from two breeds (V-line and Jabali) were randomly allocated to 3 dietary propolis experimental treatments. The experimental treatments consisted of a 2x3 factorial arrangement with two rabbit breeds and three levels of dietary propolis supplementation (0, 250 mg/kg, and 500 mg/kg). Each sub-treatment has 15 rabbits. The experimental period lasted six weeks. Results: There were no significant differences in growth performance and carcass charac-teristics due to propolis administration. Propolis supplementation at a high level significantly increased (linear; p<0.05) cellular-mediated immunity compared with the unsupplemented group. Furthermore, the rabbits receiving propolis exhibited a significant increase (linear and quadratic; p<0.03) in IgM immunoglobulins compared to the control. The current study provides further evidence that the dietary inclusion of propolis can significantly reduce pathogenic bacterial colonization in growing rabbits. The total count of microflora, E. coli , and Salmonella spp. was significantly lower (linear; p<0.01) in supplemented rabbit groups compared to the control group according to the microbiological analysis of cecal digesta. Based on breed effect, the results indicated that Jabali rabbits (local) performed better than V-line rabbits (foreign) in the majority of the studied traits. Conclusion: Dietary propolis is promising for further investigation into improving intestinal health and enhancing immunity in growing rabbits.
