1,"The Impact of Housing Systems on Stress Levels and Milk Yield in Dairy Cows","This study evaluates the effects of free-stall versus tie-stall housing systems on stress indicators and milk production in Holstein dairy cows. Cortisol levels, behavioral activity, and milk yield were monitored over a 12-week period. Cows in free-stall systems exhibited lower cortisol concentrations and higher daily milk yields, suggesting that increased mobility and social interaction contribute to improved welfare and productivity."
2,"Genetic Markers Associated with Heat Tolerance in Tropical Dairy Cattle Breeds","Heat stress significantly impacts dairy cattle productivity in tropical climates. This genome-wide association study identifies candidate genes linked to thermotolerance in Brahman × Holstein crossbred cattle. SNP markers associated with sweating efficiency, respiration rate, and rectal temperature were identified. These findings may support selective breeding programs aimed at enhancing climate resilience in dairy herds."
3,"Dietary Supplementation with Seaweed Extracts Reduces Methane Emissions in Beef Cattle","Methane emissions from ruminants are a major contributor to agricultural greenhouse gas output. This controlled feeding trial investigated the effects of *Asparagopsis taxiformis* supplementation on enteric methane production in beef cattle. Results showed a 45% reduction in methane emissions without adverse effects on feed intake or weight gain, indicating potential for seaweed-based interventions in sustainable livestock management."
4,"Social Hierarchy and Its Influence on Feeding Behavior in Confined Beef Cattle","Dominance hierarchies among confined beef cattle may influence access to feed and overall growth performance. Using RFID tracking and continuous observation, this study examines aggressive interactions and feeding patterns in group-housed cattle. Dominant animals accessed feed more frequently during peak hours, while subordinate individuals exhibited compensatory feeding behavior outside peak times. Management strategies to reduce competition are discussed."
5,"The Role of Probiotics in Enhancing Immune Function and Gut Health in Calves","Early-life gut health is critical for long-term immunity and growth in cattle. This randomized trial investigates the effects of probiotic supplementation (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains) on immune response and diarrhea incidence in pre-weaned calves. Supplemented calves showed reduced illness rates and elevated serum immunoglobulin levels, supporting the use of probiotics as a preventive health strategy."
6,"Evaluating Lameness Detection Using Wearable Sensors in Dairy Herds","Lameness is a leading cause of economic loss and animal welfare concern in dairy operations.

8,"Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns in Mastitis Pathogens from Organic vs. Conventional Dairy Farms","Mastitis remains a major disease challenge in dairy production. This study compares antimicrobial resistance profiles of common mastitis-causing bacteria (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Escherichia coli*) from organic and conventional dairy farms. Organic farms showed significantly lower resistance to commonly used antibiotics, highlighting the benefits of restricted antibiotic use in reducing resistance development."
9,"The Effects of Music Exposure on Calmness and Milking Efficiency in Dairy Cows","Environmental enrichment strategies are increasingly explored to improve dairy cow welfare. This experimental study assesses the impact of classical music exposure during milking on heart rate variability and milk let-down time. Cows exposed to music exhibited reduced heart rates and faster milk ejection, suggesting a calming effect that could enhance both welfare and productivity."
10,"Nutritional Optimization for Grass-Fed Beef Production in Temperate Climates","Grass-fed beef systems rely heavily on pasture quality for optimal growth and meat characteristics. This study investigates the impact of rotational grazing intensity and legume inclusion in pastures on weight gain, meat tenderness, and fatty acid composition. Diets with increased clover content improved average daily gain and omega-3 fatty acid levels, supporting the integration of legumes in sustainable grass-fed systems."
11,"The Influence of Pasture Diversity on Rumen Microbiota and Methane Production in Beef Cattle","This study examines how diverse pasture compositions affect rumen microbial communities and methane emissions in beef cattle. High-diversity pastures containing legumes and herbs led to shifts in microbiota favoring reduced methanogen populations, resulting in a 22% decrease in methane output compared to monoculture grass systems."
12,"Use of Precision Livestock Farming Tools for Early Detection of Lameness in Dairy Herds","Precision technologies such as pressure-sensitive flooring and gait recognition software are tested for their ability to detect lameness before visible symptoms appear. Results show early identification up to 10 days in advance of traditional scoring, allowing earlier intervention and treatment."
13,"Comparative Analysis of Colostrum Feeding Practices and Immune Outcomes in Calves","Colostrum quality and timing of feeding significantly influence calf immunity. This study compares outcomes from immediate versus delayed feeding, filtered versus unfiltered colostrum, and maternal vs. commercial replacers. Immediate feeding of high-quality maternal colostrum resulted in the highest serum IgG levels and lowest disease incidence."
14,"Effects of Shade Structures on Heat Stress and Milk Yield in Tropical Dairy Farms","In tropical regions, heat stress reduces milk production. This field trial assesses the effectiveness of shaded barn areas in mitigating heat-related productivity loss. Cows with access to shade showed lower body temperatures and maintained milk yields 12% higher than unshaded groups during peak heat periods."
15,"Assessing the Economic Viability of Organic Transition in Mid-Sized Dairy Operations","Transitioning to organic dairy farming involves significant upfront costs and yield fluctuations. This economic analysis models profitability over a five-year transition period, finding break-even points at approximately 3.5 years with long-term gains driven by premium pricing and reduced input costs."
16,"Behavioral Indicators of Social Bonding in Group-Housed Dairy Heifers","Observational data from group-housed heifers reveals consistent affiliative behaviors such as allogrooming and synchronized lying, indicating the presence of social bonds. These behaviors were associated with reduced aggression and improved weight gain, suggesting benefits to herd cohesion."
17,"Impact of Water Quality on Feed Intake and Health in Beef Cattle","Water source contamination with nitrates and sulfates can reduce feed intake and cause health issues in cattle. This study correlates water quality parameters with performance metrics and finds that sulfate levels above 500 ppm are linked to decreased growth rates and increased incidence of polioencephalomalacia."
18,"Use of Genomic Selection to Improve Fertility Traits in Dairy Bulls","Genomic selection is increasingly used to enhance fertility traits in dairy cattle. This study demonstrates that incorporating genomic data improves prediction accuracy of sire fertility by 18% over traditional pedigree-based methods, enabling faster genetic progress in breeding programs."
19,"The Role of Enrichment Devices in Reducing Stereotypic Behaviors in Confined Dairy Cows","Stereotypic behaviors such as tongue-rolling and bar-biting are common in confined dairy cows.
