ID,Title,Abstract
1,"The Impact of Environmental Enrichment on Cognitive Development in Domestic Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus)","Domestic rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are increasingly recognized as both companion animals and valuable models in behavioral research. This study investigates the effects of environmental enrichment on cognitive development and stress reduction in a controlled population of 40 young adult rabbits. Subjects were randomly assigned to either an enriched environment group (n=20), which received daily exposure to novel objects, tunnels, and foraging tasks, or a control group (n=20) housed in standard enclosures with minimal stimuli. Over a six-week observation period, subjects were assessed using a series of spatial memory tasks and habituation tests. Behavioral indicators such as exploratory activity, latency to feed, and social interaction frequency were recorded. Physiological stress levels were monitored via non-invasive fecal cortisol analysis. Results indicated that rabbits in the enriched environment exhibited significantly improved performance in spatial learning tasks (p < 0.01) and displayed reduced latency to explore novel environments compared to controls. Furthermore, fecal cortisol levels were notably lower in the enrichment group by the end of the study (p < 0.05), suggesting decreased chronic stress. These findings support the hypothesis that environmental enrichment positively influences cognitive function and emotional well-being in rabbits."
2,"Dietary Influences on Gut Microbiota Diversity in Leporidae Species","This study explores the relationship between diet composition and gut microbiome diversity in common leporids, including wild and domestic rabbits. Utilizing 16S rRNA sequencing, we analyzed fecal samples from 30 rabbits divided into three dietary groups: high-fiber, commercial pellet-based, and mixed forage diets. Significant differences in microbial community structure were observed across groups, with the high-fiber, natural forage diet showing increased alpha diversity and enrichment of fiber-degrading taxa such as Bacteroides and Ruminococcus. Additionally, rabbits on natural diets exhibited improved digestion efficiency and lower prevalence of gastrointestinal stasis symptoms. These results suggest that dietary choices have a measurable impact on the composition and functionality of the rabbit gut microbiome, with implications for both conservation and domestic animal health management."
3,"Assessing Social Behavior and Communication Patterns in Semi-Feral Rabbit Colonies","Understanding communication and social hierarchy in semi-feral rabbit colonies provides insight into the evolutionary behavior of Oryctolagus cuniculus. Through continuous observational studies and audio recording analysis, this research examines dominance signaling, grooming behaviors, and vocalization patterns within two established outdoor colonies over a 12-week period. Dominance was found to be primarily maintained through postural displays and low-frequency grunts, rather than aggressive encounters. Allogrooming was frequently observed among closely ranked individuals, suggesting its role in reinforcing social bonds. Colony size and burrow accessibility were also found to influence overall social cohesion and territorial behavior. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on lagomorph ethology and may inform better housing and enrichment strategies in captive settings."
4,"Thermoregulatory Behavior in Desert-Dwelling Rabbits Under Climate Change Scenarios","This study examines thermoregulatory adaptations in desert-dwelling leporids, specifically the black-tailed jackrabbit (*Lepus californicus*), under simulated climate change conditions. Using thermal imaging and behavioral tracking, researchers observed significant shifts in shade-seeking behavior, ear vasodilation, and nocturnal activity patterns in response to elevated ambient temperatures. The data suggest that these rabbits exhibit plasticity in thermoregulation but face increasing energetic costs as heat exposure intensifies. Findings highlight potential vulnerabilities in arid zone rabbit populations under future warming projections."
5,"Genetic Markers Associated with Disease Resistance in Farmed Rabbit Populations","In intensive rabbit farming systems, disease outbreaks pose significant economic and welfare challenges. This study identifies genetic markers associated with resistance to common pathogens such as *Pasteurella multocida* and Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A cohort of 500 farmed rabbits was genotyped and phenotyped for disease outcomes over a 12-month period. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed strong correlations with survival rates and immune response efficiency. These findings offer a foundation for selective breeding programs aimed at enhancing disease resilience in commercial rabbit lines."
6,"The Role of Play Behavior in Juvenile Rabbit Development","Play behavior is often overlooked in lagomorph developmental studies despite its potential importance in motor skill acquisition and social integration. This observational study documents play patterns in juvenile domestic rabbits (*Oryctolagus cuniculus*) during the first 12 weeks of life. Rolling, chasing, and object manipulation were the most commonly observed play types. Early-life play was correlated with improved problem-solving abilities and reduced anxiety in adulthood. These findings suggest that play serves a critical function in shaping adaptive behaviors in rabbits."
7,"Comparative Analysis of Pain Recognition and Management in Lagomorphs Across Veterinary Practices","Pain recognition in rabbits remains challenging due to their prey species nature, which often masks signs of discomfort. This multi-clinic survey compares current pain assessment protocols and analgesic practices among veterinary professionals treating lagomorph patients. Standardized pain scales were inconsistently applied, and there was wide variability in pharmacological approaches. However, clinics using multimodal analgesia reported higher recovery success rates following surgical procedures. This highlights the need for standardized, evidence-based pain management guidelines tailored to rabbits."
8,"Effects of Noise Pollution on Stress and Hearing in Captive Rabbit Colonies","Exposure to chronic noise pollution is an emerging concern in urban and agricultural settings where rabbits are kept. This experimental study evaluates the impact of sustained low-frequency noise (e.g., road traffic, machinery) on stress physiology and auditory sensitivity in a group of 24 captive rabbits. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolites and audiometric testing revealed increased stress levels and subtle hearing impairments in the noise-exposed group. These findings indicate that acoustic environment should be considered in the design of rabbit housing facilities."
9,"Nutritional Requirements and Metabolic Efficiency in Wild vs. Domestic Rabbits","This comparative nutritional study assesses metabolic efficiency and dietary needs in wild European hares (*Lepus europaeus*) and domestic rabbits (*Oryctolagus cuniculus*). Using indirect calorimetry and dietary trials, we found that wild rabbits demonstrated greater fiber digestibility and lower water requirements than their domestic counterparts. These differences likely reflect evolutionary adaptations to resource-scarce environments. Understanding these distinctions can improve feeding strategies for conservation and rehabilitation programs."
10,"Neurological Correlates of Fear Responses in Rabbits: An fMRI Study","Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this pilot study explores brain activation patterns associated with fear responses in rabbits. Awake, trained rabbits were exposed to visual and auditory threat stimuli while neural activity was recorded. Regions including the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex showed heightened activation during perceived threats. These findings provide early insights into the neurobiology of fear processing in lagomorphs and may aid in improving behavioral interventions for fearful pets."
11,"The Effects of Artificial Lighting on Circadian Rhythms in Captive Rabbits","This study investigates how artificial lighting influences circadian rhythms in domestic rabbits (*Oryctolagus cuniculus*). Using continuous activity monitoring, researchers found that exposure to constant low-level artificial light disrupted normal sleep-wake cycles, reducing nocturnal activity by 30%. Results suggest that controlled light-dark cycles are essential for maintaining healthy physiological rhythms in indoor-housed rabbits."
12,"Behavioral Responses of Rabbits to Different Handling Techniques","Handling stress is a common issue in veterinary and research settings involving rabbits. This observational study compares behavioral indicators of stress during three common handling methods: scruffing, tunnel restraint, and free-hand support. Tunnel restraint was associated with the lowest signs of distress, suggesting it may be a preferable method for minimizing stress during routine procedures."
13,"Impact of Bedding Material on Pododermatitis Incidence in Domestic Rabbits","Pododermatitis (sore hocks) is a prevalent condition in captive rabbits. This longitudinal study examines the effect of different bedding materials—wood shavings, paper-based, and fleece liners—on foot health in 60 rabbits over six months. Fleece-lined enclosures showed significantly lower incidence of pododermatitis, highlighting its potential as a welfare-friendly alternative."
14,"Reproductive Success Rates in Semi-Feral Rabbit Colonies Across Seasons","This field study evaluates seasonal variations in reproductive success among semi-feral rabbit populations. Data collected over one year indicate peak breeding activity in spring and early summer, with litter sizes decreasing significantly in winter months. Environmental temperature and food availability were identified as key factors influencing reproductive output."
15,"Auditory Sensitivity and Sound Discrimination in Young Rabbits","Using conditioned response techniques, this study explores auditory perception in juvenile rabbits. Results show that young rabbits can distinguish between high-frequency tones (<20 kHz) and respond differently to predator vs. non-predator sounds. These findings suggest an early-developing capacity for sound discrimination that may aid survival in natural environments."
16,"Effectiveness of Clicker Training in Modifying Fear-Based Behavior in Rescue Rabbits","Clicker training has gained popularity as a behavior modification tool in dogs but remains underexplored in rabbits. A pilot program involving 20 rescued rabbits found significant reductions in fear behaviors after four weeks of daily clicker sessions. Trained rabbits exhibited increased willingness to approach humans and interact with novel objects."
17,"Nutritional Composition of Wild Forage and Its Suitability for Pet Rabbits","Pet rabbit diets often rely on commercial pellets, which may not fully replicate the nutritional complexity of wild forage. This comparative analysis shows that wild grasses and herbs contain higher fiber and lower starch content than most commercial feeds. Recommendations are made for integrating more diverse plant matter into pet rabbit diets for improved digestive health."
18,"The Role of Burrow Architecture in Thermoregulation Among Wild Rabbit Populations","Burrow structure plays a critical role in thermal regulation for wild rabbits. This ecological study compares burrow designs across varying climates and finds that deeper, multi-entrance burrows provide better insulation during extreme weather conditions. Such insights may inform habitat conservation strategies and enclosure design for captive rabbits."
19,"Evaluation of Common Analgesics for Postoperative Pain Management in Rabbits","Post-surgical pain management in rabbits is often challenging due to species-specific drug metabolism. This clinical trial compares the efficacy and safety of meloxicam, buprenorphine, and carprofen in post-operative recovery. Buprenorphine showed superior analgesia without significant side effects, making it a promising candidate for standard rabbit surgical protocols."
20,"The Influence of Cage Size on Physical Activity and Muscle Development in Juvenile Rabbits","Restricted movement in small cages may impact physical development in growing rabbits. This experimental study measured locomotor activity and muscle mass in rabbits housed in varying cage sizes. Larger cages correlated with increased hopping frequency and greater hindlimb muscle tone, supporting the need for minimum space standards in rabbit housing."
21,"Social Learning in Rabbits: Observational Learning of Food Preferences","This study tests whether rabbits can learn food preferences through observation. Subjects observed conspecifics consuming either preferred or less-preferred foods and later selected food items based on prior observation. The results indicate that rabbits exhibit basic social learning capabilities, which could be applied in dietary training and enrichment programs."
22,"Evaluating the Use of Virtual Fencing in Controlling Free-Ranging Rabbit Movement","Virtual fencing technology, commonly used in livestock, is explored here for managing rabbit populations. Trials using auditory cues to define boundaries showed moderate success, with some rabbits adapting to the system within two weeks. Further refinement may lead to humane, non-invasive population control tools."
23,"Development and Validation of a Rabbit-Specific Behavioral Pain Scale","Accurate pain assessment in rabbits is crucial for both clinical care and research ethics. This study develops and validates a comprehensive behavioral pain scale tailored specifically to rabbits. The scale incorporates ear position, posture, grooming habits, and vocalization, and demonstrates strong inter-rater reliability and sensitivity to change over time."
24,"The Effect of Ultraviolet Light Exposure on Vitamin D Synthesis in Indoor-Housed Rabbits","Vitamin D deficiency is common in indoor-housed rabbits. This experimental study measures serum vitamin D levels in rabbits exposed to artificial UVB light. After eight weeks, UVB-exposed rabbits showed a significant increase in 25(OH)D concentrations compared to controls, suggesting that UV supplementation can help prevent metabolic bone disease in indoor rabbits."
25,"Exploring the Impact of Human Interaction on Longevity in Companion Rabbits","A retrospective analysis of 200 companion rabbits found a positive correlation between regular human interaction and lifespan. Rabbits receiving daily handling, playtime, and mental stimulation lived an average of 2.4 years longer than those with minimal interaction. These findings underscore the importance of enriched human-animal relationships in promoting longevity in pet rabbits."
